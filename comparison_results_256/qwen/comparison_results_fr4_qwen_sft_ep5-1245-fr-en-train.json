Post-war, it served as a gunnery training ship and rejoined active service briefly in 1929. Decommissioned in 1931, it was sold for scrap in 1932 due to naval treaty limitations. Historian John Keegan noted it as \"the most beautiful warship in the world.\" Its specifications included a displacement of 28,500 tons, a length of 704 feet, and a top speed of 28 knots. Armament consisted of four 13.5-inch guns, twelve 6-inch guns, two 3-inch AA guns, and four torpedo tubes. Armor ranged from 3-9 inches in thickness across different parts of the ship. After its decommissioning, it was scrapped in 1932.",

Due to delays in launching torpedoes, the U.S. ships missed their opportunity, and when they engaged, their positions were revealed by muzzle flashes. The Japanese then effectively used their \"Long Lance\" torpedoes, sinking one U.S. cruiser and severely damaging three others while failing to complete their supply mission.

The U.S. fleet then attacked the Japanese ships with full firepower, leading to the destruction of another destroyer. This turned the tide of the battle in favor of the Americans, who suffered 395 to 417 deaths versus 197 to 211 injuries for the Japanese fleet.

It restructured the Church of England, including hiring new ministers, adopting new doctrines, and producing various documents like the Westminster Confession and the Westminster Shorter and Larger Catechisms. The Assembly was influenced by Puritans and their military alliance with Scotland, with the intent to bring the English Church closer to the Presbyterian Church in the UK (Episcopalianism). However, different factions within the Church disagreed too much, leading to division and then back-to-back assembly sessions in 1660, when the document was officially repudiated. The Assembly also worked in the Reformed Protestant theological tradition, committing itself to the doctrine of predestination, which holds that God selects specific people to be saved. The main actors included the会长（Diplomatic Agent）Philip Nye, who made controversial remarks about presbyterian church government. The assembly adopted several doctrinal and pastoral reforms, though these were never fully implemented due to tensions and divisions within the Church. The assembly played a crucial role in shaping the religious landscape of the English-speaking world at the time. 2",

These bombings occurred primarily from 1942 to 1945, targeting both military installations and civilian targets, including the [[Doolittle Raid]], [[Kuril Islands raids]], and strategic bombing campaigns. Strategic bombing was introduced by the United States as a means of mass destruction against Japanese military infrastructure, leading to widespread destruction and displacement across the entire Pacific theater of operation. Despite some successes, such as the [strategic bombing of Pearl Harbor], the overall impact of these bombings on Japanese society and morale remains controversial and has been criticized by historians and modern scholars. The bombings had significant effects on Japanese morale and economy, leading to high levels of industrial output and increased industrial production. However, they also caused immense suffering and loss of life, particularly among civilians, and contributed to the eventual surrender of Japan.

It measures up to 70 cm in length, with a slender body, short head, and tail, and two dorsal fins angled backwards. Key identification features include black and white spots on the back, sides, and fins, and distinctively long and thin claspers in males. Active at dawn and night, it preys on bottom-living invertebrates and bony fish. Oviparous, females lay egg capsules on the bottom, and young hatch after 4–6 months. Captivity adaptation makes it well suited to aquariums, though it is occasionally considered a minor bycatch in fisheries. Concerns about its population arise due to increasing fishing and habitat degradation. The species is not currently listed as endangered but requires careful conservation management. Early descriptions date back to the 1830s, with variations in taxonomic classification. The coral catshark is relatively shy during the day and migrates at twilight and late at night. It is oviparous, with two clutch sizes: a smaller group laying single egg capsules and a larger group hatching simultaneously. The species is not listed as endangered",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The Dirac delta function is a generalized function defined on the real numbers with zero value everywhere except at zero, and integral over the entire real line equals one. It can be represented heuristically as:\n\nδ(x) = {0, if x ≠ 0\n          ∞, if x = 0}\n\nThis function can be derived using limits or measure theory. The Dirac delta function is named after Paul Dirac and has widespread applications in physics and engineering, particularly in modeling point masses and instantaneous impulses. It is a continuous analogue of the Kronecker delta function and was initially controversial due to its discontinuity. The graph of the Dirac delta function shows a peak at x = 0 and decays to zero as |x| approaches infinity. It is used to model various phenomena such as impulses, point charges, and electron states. For example, in determining the dynamics of a billiard ball, the force exerted by another ball is approximated by a Dirac delta function, reducing the need for detailed elasticity calculations at subatomic levels. The force is uniform over a small time interval, reflecting the instantaneity of the momentum transfer.  The Dirac delta function is derived using limits or measure theory, and it is named after Paul Dirac",

      "base_model_summary": "Deinonychus was a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur. It lived during the early Cretaceous period, between 115 million and 108 million years ago. The species lived in North America and was a large carnivorous dinosaur with a terrible claw. It was named after John Ostrom, who studied it in the late 1960s. The fossil record shows that the species existed for about 11 million years before becoming extinct. Deinonychus was similar to other dromaeosaurids like Velociraptor, but also evolved features that allowed it to be more active and agile than its reptilian ancestors. Ostrom observed that the tail vertebrae of the species are highly developed and suggest that it had a strong sense of direction. Although it was a bipedal animal, it also possessed a powerful hind leg, suggesting it had some advantages compared to other theropods.\nThe summary captures the essential information about Deinonychus, including its classification as a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur, its living period, its size, and the evolutionary features that led to its extinction.

It was discovered in Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and other states, with fossils found in the Cloverly Formation and Antlers Formation of the Lower Cretaceous period. John Ostrom's study of Deinonychus in the late 1960s significantly changed scientific perceptions of dinosaurs, contributing to the \"dinosaur renaissance\" and sparking debate on whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded or cold-blooded. The species name \"antirrhopus\" refers to the function of the tail as a counterbalance, while the skull shape suggests an agile, active predator. The tail vertebrae have a series of ossified tendons and a curved process at the base, resembling a bird's nest, but not a fish's tail. The fossil evidence indicates that the tail could bend laterally with high degrees of flexibility, contrary to earlier beliefs. Both the Cloverly and Antlers formations contain evidence of Deinonychus, with findings closely associated with tooth material suggesting a diet composed primarily of insects.

This process, named after Christopher Columbus, was closely tied to the European colonization and global trade. While some exchanges were intentional, others were unintentional. The exchange led to the extinction of the indigenous populations in the Americas, resulting in a 80-to-95 percent reduction in the indigenous populations from the 15th century onwards. Communicable diseases brought significant losses to the native populations, particularly in the Caribbean. The Columbian exchange had a profound impact on the cultures and economies of both hemispheres. Key crops like maize, potato, tomato, tobacco, cassava, sweet potatoes, chili pepper, and rice became important worldwide. Livestock species like wheat, sugar cane, and cattle also played crucial roles. The exchange facilitated the introduction of these agricultural and livestock technologies into the Americas, contributing to increased food production and population growth in the Old World.

He combined the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the Northern Renaissance with long flowing lines and brilliant colours. Born in Meersburg, Germany, he apprenticed himself to the Early Netherlandish painters in Cologne and excelled at commissions such as those for the visit of Frederick III. He is best known for his altarpiece painted for the Cologne Cathedral, the Dombild Altarpiece, which has since become one of the most significant works in European art history. Though exact dates are unknown, he is believed to have died around 40 years after completing the commission. Lochner's style and influence on subsequent artists is immense, particularly the \"sweetness and grace\" of his Madonna panels. Limited attribution remains challenging today. 400 years after the initial attribution, works attributed to him were catalogued in Cologne Cathedral. 19th-century research has helped confirm his identity, leading to the first proper attribution of his paintings. 20th-century studies have highlighted the numerous copies created during the 15th century,",

Six ships, HMS Duncan, HMS Albemarle, HMS Cornwallis, HMS Exmouth, HMS Montagu, and HMS Russell, were ordered to counter the rapid second-class battleships of Russia. Key design considerations included a high top speed, consistent firepower with limited displacement, and protective measures that evolved around the bow. All ships served in the Mediterranean Fleet and later the Home, Channel, and Atlantic Fleets. During World War I, they were deployed on the Northern Patrol to block Germany, but none played a direct role in military action. The ships' lifespan was relatively short, with two serving in Europe and one in the Pacific during the war. They were decommissioned and scrapped in 1919. The class introduced several unique features, including a revised belt armor and different bulkheads. Their low speeds and heavy armor contributed to their vulnerability to surface warfare. The class reflects the need for shipbuilders to balance speed and firepower with safety requirements.  |",

The common impala and black-faced impala have distinct physical characteristics, such as a glossy coat, red horns, and different habitat preferences. It is known for its jumping ability, mating rituals, rutting behavior, and lactation period.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The impala, also known as rooibok or black-footed high-horn antelope, is a medium-sized antelope found in eastern and southern Africa. It is the only extant member of the genus Aepyceros and has two subspecies: the common impala and the black-faced impala. Both species reach 70–92 cm at the shoulder and weigh 40–76 kg. They have a glossy, reddish brown coat, with slender, lyre-shaped horns measuring 45–92 cm. The impala is active during the day and may begregous or territorial, with distinct social groups including territorial males, bachelor herds, and female herds. They are known for their predator-strategy, specialized feeding habits, and unique rutting behavior. The rut occurs in May and involves dominant males fighting over dominance. The gestation period is approximately six to seven months, and a single calf is born after nursing for four to six months. The impala is a herbivore, grazing on monocots, dicots, forbs, fruits, and acacia pods. The animal population is monitored using census methods, and the species is listed as a LC (Low Concern) on the I",

The dire wolf lived primarily in the Americas, and its fossils have been found in various habitats including prairie, forest, and desert regions.

The dire wolf's skull and dentition were similar to those of the largest contemporary gray wolf, while it had larger teeth and stronger bite force compared to most modern canids. These adaptations likely allowed it to predate large, herbivorous mammals and adapt to different environments over long periods. In North America, the dire wolf preyed mainly on Late Pleistocene megafaunal species such as western horses, ground sloths, mastodons, and ancient mammoths, which were hunted throughout much of North America's history. The dire wolf lived between 125,000-9,500 years ago during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, making it a significant paleontological find.

Ecgberht’s descendants continued to rule Wessex and eventually all of England until 1013.

Born around 1182, he is best known for being the ancestor of the Mongol Khanate of the Golden Horde. Jochi was the son of Börte, a captive of the Merkit tribe. Despite being considered Temüjin's son, Jochi's birth came under suspicion due to prior marriages and rape claims. Temüjin treated him accordingly, while others in the kingdom, including Börte's other sons Chagatai, disputed his legitimacy. After founding the Mongol empire, Temüjin entrusted Jochi with military forces and extended his rule over vast territories in the west. During the invasion of the Khwarazmian Empire (1219-1221), Jochi subdued northern cities and tribes. However, tensions between Jochi, his brothers, and Genghis Khan continued, leading to his death in 1225 when he became bereft. His son Batu Khan was chosen to rule his territories. Jochi's exact birth date and place are not specified in the given text. 21 January 2024 1",

It began around the late 4th millennium BC with hieroglyphic and hieratic scripts. Literary works initially included funerary texts, letters, hymns, and autobiographies. Narrative literature emerged in the Middle Kingdom due to a rise in literacy and the growth of a scribe class. This literature was primarily produced by elite scribes connected to royal courts. Middle Egyptian became a classical language in the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian first appeared in writing. New Kingdom scribes continued to copy and canonize texts from the Middle Kingdom. Key works include \"Sinuhe,\" \"The Eloquent Peasant,\" \"Instructions of Amenemhat,\" and \"The Loyalist Teaching.\" Literature was preserved on papyrus, ostraca, wooden boards, monumental stone structures, and coffins.

The New Kingdom (16th century BC to 11th century BC) saw the standardized Late Egyptian vernacular language and the appearance of the canonized text \"Instruction of Amenemhat\".

      "reference_summary": "Basiliscus was the Eastern Roman emperor from January 475 to August 476. Initially a military leader under Emperor Leo I, Basiliscus led a failed invasion of the Vandal Kingdom in 468, resulting in significant financial loss for the empire. After Leo I’s death and the brief reigns of Leo II and Zeno, Basiliscus, aided by his sister Empress Verina, overthrew Zeno in a coup. Though initially acclaimed emperor by the Eastern Roman Senate, Basiliscus soon lost popular support due to heavy taxation, controversial religious policies favoring miaphysitism, and a perceived divine punishment in the form of a natural disaster. His reign was marked by alienating key allies, including the execution of his co-conspirator Patricius. Eventually, Zeno regained power, and Basiliscus was executed in Limnae (modern-day Cappadocia, Turkey) around 476/477. Summary ends here. ",

He held the位of magister militum per Thracias under his brother-in-law, Emperor Leo I. Commanding the army during the invasion of the Vandals in 468, he was defeated and sentenced to death. After being exiled, he sought refuge in the Hagia Sophia and later retires to Neapolis. When Leo II became emperor in 474, Zeno ascended the throne, and Verina plotted to have Basiliscus declared emperor. The plot was successful, and Basiliscus was acclaimed by the Eastern Roman Senate. However, his support among his subjects and allies suffered setbacks, leading to his exile and eventual death in 476.

Throughout the text, Sarmiento argued that Argentina needed to modernize and industrialize in order to compete with Western powers, and that the past was rife with examples of barbarism.

The song reached number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it one of Swift's best-selling singles, and was also played on television shows and in the set list for the 1989 World Tour. A re-recorded version of the song, titled \"Out of the Woods (Taylor's Version),\" was released for the re-recorded album \"1989 (Taylor's Version).\" The song received mixed reviews, with some critics noting its production style and narrative lyrics, while others found it too 1980s-influenced. The song did not receive the commercial success of some other Swift releases, such as \"Red.\" 39 views per",

      "reference_summary": "A binary search tree (BST) is a rooted binary tree data structure where each node's key is greater than all keys in its left subtree and less than all keys in its right subtree. BSTs enable efficient binary search for fast lookup, addition, and removal of data. Developed in the 1960s, they offer average-case performance of O(log n) for insert, delete, and search operations, but can degrade to O(n) in the worst case due to arbitrary insertions. Self-balancing variants like AVL trees address this by maintaining balanced tree heights, ensuring O(log n) performance even in the worst case. BSTs are used to implement dynamic sets, lookup tables, priority queues, and in sorting algorithms.",

It has linear space complexity and can support constant-time insertions, deletions, and searches compared to unsorted arrays. Different variations exist to ensure worst-case performance, such as AVL trees. These trees have applications in sorting algorithms, set implementation, priority queues, and dynamic sets.\n        \n        This article provides a comprehensive overview of the binary search tree data structure, highlighting its advantages, limitations, and historical development. It covers its foundational elements like the concept, types, properties, space complexity, and various implementations along with their characteristics. By understanding this tree, one can effectively utilize it in computational problems ranging from data retrieval to sorting algorithms.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "A binary search tree (BST) is a rooted binary tree data structure where each node's key is greater than all keys in the left subtree and less than all keys in the right subtree. BSTs ensure linear-time average complexity for these operations, with worst-case performance degrading to logarithmic time. They are highly efficient for storing and querying labeled data, like sets and lookup tables, and are used in sorting algorithms like tree sorts. The discovery of BSTs dates back to the 1960s, with contributions from P.F. Windley, Andrew Donald Booth, Andrew Colin, and Thomas N. Hibbard. The algorithm has been implemented in various abstract data types and sorting algorithms. The BST structure involves several operations: search, traversal, insert, and delete, with the best and worst-case complexities both O(log n). Self-balancing versions, like AVL trees, are designed to maintain this property and have a worst-case complexity of O(n). The algorithm uses recursive structures and comparisons to achieve these properties, ensuring linear efficiency even under heavy load. 20th-century developments have seen the introduction of balanced trees with improved worst-case complexities. 21st century has seen the advent of self-balancing binary search trees like AVL trees, which offer significant improvements",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Discoverment is the second studio album by the French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 12 March 2001 by Virgin Records. It marked a transition from the Chicago house of their previous album, \"Homework,\" to a house style influenced by disco, post-disco, garage house, and R&B. Produced by Thomas Bangalter, the album includes extensive sampling and collaborations with Romanthony, Todd Edwards, and DJ Sneak. The video for \"Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5secret 5ystem\" features the merging of science fiction and the entertainment industry, in collaboration with Leiji Matsumoto. Before its release, Daft Punk would have dressed up like robots and launched a music festival called Daft Club. \"Discovery\" reached international popularity, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time, with six singles including the popular \"One More Time.\" It significantly influenced pop music over subsequent years. In 2020, Rolling Stone listed it at number 236 on their list of the greatest albums of all time. The album also includes the single \"Something About Us\" and the concept track \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.\"",

These regions are typically small, ranging from a few to hundreds of light years in size, with a density from a few to about a million particles per cubic centimetre. They are often found in molecular clouds of partially ionized gas, like the Orion Nebula, and can be associated with giant molecular clouds. H II regions can appear as clusters of stars, including supernovae, and their presence helps us understand the distances and compositions of galaxies. Spiral and irregular galaxies tend to have fewer H II regions, while elliptical galaxies generally have more. Some galaxies, like the Milky Way, have extremely large H II regions concentrated in specific parts of their disks. The term \"H II\" stands for \"Hydrogen Ionization Region,\" and it is used to describe regions where neutral atomic hydrogen exists. A H II region is characterized by its ionized state and the presence of neutral atomic hydrogen. The shape and size of H II regions vary, being either smooth or complex, and their age and star formation history are important factors in their location within the galaxy.

The story follows Ebenezer Scrooge, an elderly miser, who visits the ghosts of his past and future Christmases. Through these visits, Scrooge is transformed into a more compassionate person. The novella, while secular in its beliefs, contains deeper themes like redemption and the nature of Christmas traditions. Published on 19 December 1843, it sold out within weeks and became extremely popular, with thirteen editions printed by the end of 1844. The story was later copyrighted and intentionally read by Dickens to ensure his profits. Illegally copied, it led to the publishing of multiple copies. The novella remains significant in understanding the zeitgeist of the early Victorian Christmas season. It has been translated into many languages and adapted for various media. The text is structured into five staves, each representing a different aspect of Scrooge's transformation.

He became World Champion in 1972 by defeating Boris Spassky in a match that garnered global attention during the Cold War. Fischer refused to defend his title in 1975 due to disagreements with FIDE, leading to Anatoly Karpov's default victory. Fischer disappeared from public view but reemerged in 1992 to play an unofficial rematch against Spassky, which led to legal issues and his eventual exile.

He later returned to participate in the World Championship, winning the unofficial rematch with Boris Spassky in 1992. He died in Reykjavík, Iceland, in 2008.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Robert James Fischer, an American chess grandmaster born on March 9, 1943, was the eleventh World Chess Champion. A chess prodigy, he won his first US Championships at the age of 14 and won the 1972 World Championship by sweeping matches with Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen by 6–0. The title match against Boris Spassky of the USS Russia was a public relations coup, winning by a narrow margin. In 1975, Fischer refused to defend his title over differences with FIDE, leading to the automatic selection of Anatoly Karpov as World Champion. Fischer later re-emerged in 1992 to win the rematch against Spassky, but was then held back in Yugoslavia by US sanctions. He lived as an emigrant until his death in 2008. Fischer made significant contributions to chess literature with \"My 60 Memorable Games\" and developed a modified chess timing system, Chess960, which has become standard in top tournaments and matches. He also invented the Fischer random chess variant. The article notes that Fischer never played for Iceland and did not have a famous chess opponent there. 2785 (",

The definition of the effect specifies that it pertains specifically to self-assessment, particularly among individuals with low skill. The Dunning–Kruger effect is oftenmisunderstood as a generalizing bias about people with low intelligence, when it actually refers to systematic errors in judgment and evaluation.  The article also mentions potential practical consequences, including making bad decisions and inhibiting personal development. The discussion concludes that while the effect is true to some extent, it is not always immediate and has far-reaching implications.  Finally, the article notes",

This strategy benefits both the predator and prey by avoiding potential harm. The term was coined by Edward Bagnall Poulton and is exemplified by species like the poison frog and honey badger. Aposematism can be genuine, mimicked (Müllerian mimicry), or bluffed (Batesian mimicry and deimatic displays). The primary defence is the warning signal, while secondary defences are the actual protective mechanisms.",

It consists of brightly colored, conspicuous signals such as colouration, sound, odour, aggression, or sharp spines.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Aposematism is the advertising by animals to potential predators that they are not worth attacking or eating, often through toxic substances, offensive odors, or other perceivable characteristics. This helps both the predator and the prey avoid potential harm. The term comes from Edward Bagnall Poulton's 1877 work on warning coloration. Aposematic signals can be true or false, false ones being similar-looking aposematic models. True aposematic signals are brightly colored and distinctive, while false ones are similar-looking but harmless. Both predators and prey benefit from these signals. The term was first used to describe the warning coloration of poison frogs, later expanded to include mimicry in animals. Aposematic signals can be useful in Batesian mimicry where the mimicking species closely resembles the target species, sharing protection with others. The term comes from the Ancient Greek words \"apo\" meaning away and \"sēma\" meaning sign, referring to warnings about danger. The functions of aposematism vary: they can be neutral (for example, warning about food sources) or defensive (like camouflage). The example provided is the flamboyant cuttlefish colouring to warn against toxicity.  Aposematism is employed in various ways",

      "reference_summary": "Synthetic diamonds, also known as lab-grown or laboratory-created diamonds, are produced through controlled technological processes rather than mined. They are made of pure carbon crystallized into the same isotropic 3D form as natural diamonds, sharing identical chemical and physical properties. As of 2023, the largest lab-grown diamond weighed 30.18 carats. Attempts to synthesize diamonds began in the late 19th century, but reproducible synthesis was first achieved in 1953. Today, the primary methods for producing synthetic diamonds include high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques. Detonation synthesis and ultrasonic treatment of graphite are additional, less common methods. The properties of synthetic diamonds vary based on the manufacturing process, including their color, which can differ due to varying levels of nitrogen impurities.",
      "base_model_summary": "Synthetic diamonds are artificial forms of carbon that are created in controlled industrial processes. They can be manufactured into different colors and sizes, such as yellow, green-yellow, green-blue, light-blue, light-blue and dark blue. Their chemical composition is the same as naturally formed diamonds but differs significantly due to the presence of nitrogen impurities. Synthetic diamonds are created using the high-pressure-high-temperature (''HPHT'') and chemical vapor deposition (''CVD'') techniques. Other methods include detonation synthesis, which uses detonating explosives to create large amounts of small diamonds, and treatment of graphite with ultrasonic energy. Currently, there is limited commercial use for synthetic diamonds and their development continues.\n        This article discusses the history and current state of synthetic diamonds and how they are created and used. It highlights the significance of this technology in the field of diamond processing and its potential impact on the industry.

Gene expression involves copying DNA into RNA, and the resulting RNA can be directly functional (e.g., transcription factor binding sites) or used as a template for protein synthesis. Genes transmit traits through inheritance, where they combine to form different phenotypes in each generation. Traits can be influenced by polygenes and gene-environment interactions. Alleles encoding different variations of a gene lead to distinct phenotypes. Genes evolve due to natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "\"The Cats of Ulthar\" is a short story by American fantasy writer H. P. Lovecraft, written in June 1920. The story follows an unnamed narrator who recounts the story of how a law in the town of Ulthar, named after a cotter and his wife, forbids the killing of cats. The story involves a local couple, the Cotter and his wife, who trap and kill cats to the extreme, leading to the disappearance of a kitten named Menes. Menes invokes a prayer before leaving town that causes the local felines to swarm the cat-killer's house and devour them. Influenced by Lord Dunsany, the tale is considered one of Lovecraft's best short stories and has been referenced in his later works like \"The Other Gods\" and \"The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath\". Published in the literary journal \"Tryout\" in November 1920, the story remains in the public domain. The synopsis briefly describes the events without delving into excessive detail, maintaining clarity while capturing the essence of the story.  The summary is concise yet comprehensive, covering key elements of the story without unnecessary details.  The summary also notes the impact of Edward Plunkett, 1",

Its distinctive black throat patch differentiates it during breeding season. The breeding season varies by location, starting in April in southern regions and later in the north. Nests are built near lakes, containing usually two eggs. Incubation lasts 27-29 days, and chicks are fed small fish and invertebrates. The adult diet consists mainly of fish, caught through diving. Breeding success rates vary widely due to predation and flooding. The species is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN.",
      "base_model_summary": "The black-throated loon is a migratory aquatic bird of the Northern Hemisphere, native to freshwater lakes in northern Europe and Asia. It breeds in cold climates and winters on sheltered coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. There are currently two subspecies, designated as Gavia arctica and Gavia arctica viridigularis. The bird's range includes both freshwaters and estuaries. Breeding occurs in April in the southern parts of its range, while wintering is found along sheltered coastal regions in North America, Europe, and Asia. The black-throated loon is closely related to the Pacific loon, though its exact relationship remains debated. Its timing of breeding is influenced by temperature and weather patterns. It typically nests in oval-shaped nests with the clutch size varying depending on the location. The adult catches its prey using its sharp talons, diving from the surface to catch fish. Despite its cold-blooded nature, it successfully hunts fish by itself or in pairs, often using stealth techniques such as burrowing into the mud to locate their prey. Overall, the black-throated loon is a fascinating example of how birds adapt to their environment and maintain their survival through various strategies. The timing of its breeding season varies",

The former is the species of concern due to hybridization with the Pacific loon, while the latter is sister to the Pacific loon and includes the common loon and yellow-billed loon. The black-throated loon measures about 70 cm in length and weighs between 1.3 kg and 3.4 kg. In breeding plumage, the male has predominantly black upperparts with white throat patches, while the female has lighter upperparts with black throat patches. The nest is oval-shaped, about 23 cm across, built near the breeding lake or on vegetation emerging from it, and typically laid two to three brown-green eggs. The chicks are fed on small fish and invertebrates, with adults mainly catching food by foraging alone or in pairs.",

The battle's outcome was marked by the loss of one U.S. carrier, two Japanese destroyers, and minimal American losses, whereas the Japanese suffered significant damage and were unable to continue their offensive strategy effectively. This victory helped isolate the American fleet and put pressure on Japan to reconsider its defensive posture. 21,300 tons of American fleet assets were destroyed, including 21,300 pounds of armor, while only 150 aircraft were lost, mostly to anti-aircraft fire. 307 Americans died in action, including 3 who surrendered as prisoners",
