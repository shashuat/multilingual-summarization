The last naked-eye supernova observed in our galaxy was Kepler's Supernova in 1604; the most recent one visible without a telescope was SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Supernovae are primarily caused by two mechanisms: re-ignition of nuclear fusion in white dwarfs or gravitational collapse of massive stars' cores. These events expel vast amounts of material into space, enriching the interstellar medium with elements crucial for star formation and contributing to cosmic rays and possibly gravitational waves. The term \"supernova\" was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s to distinguish these phenomena from less luminous novae.

These explosions cause stellar matter to break down into lighter elements, such as oxygen and calcium, and are a significant source of cosmic rays and even gravitational waves. The first direct observation of a supernova in the Milky Way was Keplers Supernova in 1604, followed by other supernovae like SN 1987A, which was detected through modern telescopes. Supernovae are characterized by their extreme brightness, with the brightest occurring in a galaxy's center. The mechanism for triggering them involves either the re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a white dwarf or the disruption of a massive star's core due to gravitational collapse.

Key examples include the Stegosaurus, Triceratops, and Apatosaurus. The earliest known member of this group, Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, lived during the Early Jurassic, while the last known one, Smok, occurred during the Late Jurassic. Archaeopteryx, a basal dinosaur, was discovered in late 2018. Some authors have proposed paraphyletic relationships among some species, particularly between Sauropodomora and Ornithomorfis.

The element maintains its classification as an alkali metal until it undergoes significant chemical changes. The periodic trends and properties of francium contrast significantly with those of its neighboring elements, making it distinct from the other heavy metals. Its decay follows a fast-moving pattern similar to radioactive decay, with every new isotope having a slightly longer half-life than its immediate predecessor.

The prognosis for COPD varies among individuals based on its severity and underlying conditions. In summary, COPD involves the gradual constriction of the lungs' airways and air sacs, often caused by exposure to smoke or air pollutants, and leads to reduced airflow capacity over time, resulting in symptoms such as shortness of breath and cough.

The plot hinges on Bond meeting up with Doctor No, a reclusive Chinese-German operative, at the island of Crab Key. Despite initial resistance from local residents, Bond manages to gain access to the island and learn that No is behind the disappearances. The novel faced widespread negative criticism in Britain, with Paul Johnson of the New Statesman dismissing it as a \"sex, snobbery and sadism\" novel. However, when released on the American market, it受到了更正面的欢迎。\"Dr. No\" was adapted into a movie in 1962 and a TV series in 1958. The eponymous villain was later changed to the crooked fox Mulder in the \"Fearless Four\" film trilogy. The novel inspired other adaptations such as Sean Connery playing the lead role in a James Bond film and a BBC radio adaptation. In his review, Ian Fleming noted that the setting was unrealistic and the characters were drawn in a constricted manner. The plot revolves around Bond's pursuit through the Caribbean island of Crab Key, where he uncovers the truth about Doctor No and",

His most significant contribution was proposing the theory of atomic structure, which explained why atoms consist of discrete energy levels and electrons that oscillate between these energy levels. Bohr also established the relationship between wave motion and particle behavior, a principle later known as the complementarity principle. Bohr significantly contributed to scientific research through his work at the University of Copenhagen and his role in promoting scientific debate. He founded the Bohr Institute, which is located at the University of Copenhagen, and mentored many prominent scientists. Notably, he predicted the discovery of hafnium, a metal that was named after the city of Copenhagen. Bohr died in Copenhagen and is buried there. He was awarded numerous international honors, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. **Summary in Chain:** Niels Bohr (1885-1962), a Danish physiker and founder of quantum mechanics, is celebrated for his discovery of the Bohr model of the atom and the complementarity principle, which explains how electrons can exist in",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The Christmas Truce of World War I occurred on December 24-26, 1914, when hundreds of soldiers from different countries across the Western Front exchanged Christmas cards and greetings. This temporary ceasefire allowed them to rest, exercise, and regroup, without engaging in direct combat. The action was marked by festive decorations, smiling faces, and friendly banter, making it one of the most famous incidents of the war. Despite its brief duration, it played a crucial role in smoothing out the chaos of trench warfare and fostering goodwill among soldiers. The Truce was particularly notable because it occurred during a time when the fighting had largely ceased, and soldiers were more willing to compromise for the sake of a common goal. The extent of the ceasefire varied depending on the specific area, with some parts of the frontline remaining fiercely fought. It served as a reminder of humanity in the face of violence and shaped post-war perceptions of peace and cooperation. The Truce also had practical benefits, such as allowing soldiers to visit each other for medical checks or to help each other off the job. Its significance extends beyond just that single day; it is considered one of the most poignant moments of the conflict, often used as a basis for later humanitarian efforts and international laws.

      "reference_summary": "SMS Schlesien was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the German Imperial Navy between 1904 and 1908. Commissioned in 1908, it served in the High Seas Fleet during World War I, participating in the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Post-war, Schlesien was retained under the Treaty of Versailles and used for training until it was reactivated in 1927. It was damaged by mines in 1945 and scrapped between 1949 and 1956. Initially armed with four 28 cm guns, its weaponry was modified over the years. Despite its obsolescence compared to newer designs like HMS Dreadnought, Schlesien played a role in German naval operations for several decades.",

Born in Vermont, he moved with his family to New York and Philadelphia, eventually becoming a well-known author known for his comprehensive collection \"The Poets and Poetry of America\" (1842).

Griswold faced conflicts with Edgar Allan Poe over whom to publish his poetry, and later fought for Poe's widow Frances Sargent Osgood. He was known for his rigorous editing standards and criticized others' works without permission. His life was marked by impulsiveness and unpredictability, influenced by his religious upbringing. He died in 1857 in New York City. Griswold was also an early advocate for public schools to include literature education. He was an expert on American poetry, an early proponent of copyright legislation, and someone who disregarded others' intellectual property without permission.

However, when Prasutagus died, the Roman governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus intercepted the request for help and invaded the Roman settlement, forcing the Britons to abandon it.

It is characterized by difficulties in spelling, reading quickly, handwriting, sounding out words, pronouncing words when reading aloud, and understanding what one reads. Symptoms vary in intensity and may include difficulties in spelling, attention, and concentration. Dyslexia is genetic and environmental factors interact to cause it. Some forms of dyslexia are related to specific brain injuries. Diagnosis involves a series of memory, spelling, vision, and reading tests. There is an estimated 3-7% chance of having the condition, with no known risk factors for death. No current cure exists, but early intervention and appropriate education can improve outcomes. Treatment options include adjusting teaching methods and providing medication if necessary. Regular assessments are essential to monitor progress and adjust instruction accordingly. The prevalence of dyslexia is higher among certain groups, including those with ADHD, developmental language disorders, and difficulties with numbers. Dyslexia has been recognized since the late 20th century and was previously known as \"word blindness.\" The cause of dyslexia is multifactorial, influenced by both genetics and environment. Some forms of dyslexia are associated with specific traumatic events. The disease is considered heritable, and there is evidence supporting its association",

He is best known for his novel \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\" (1929). Born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), Döblin moved with his family to Berlin when he was ten years old. He lived in Berlin for almost four decades, collaborating with key figures of the pre-war and Weimar era German cultural scene, including Herbert Walden and Expressionists Bertolt Brecht and Thomas Mann. Only a few years after publishing \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\", Döblin was forced to flee Nazi Germany due to its influence on the cultural climate of postwar Germany. He spent his final years in France but felt unwell and struggled financially during this time. Despite the canonization of his work, Döblin is sometimes characterized as having little impact or neglected by critics and readers alike. His last years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties.

It was initially based on philosophical ideas, such as the idea that matter consists of indivisible particles. Later, it was refined through experimentation and observation, leading to the discovery of the internal structure of atoms and the separation of elements. The article also mentions the historical context of atomic theory and its significance in the field of chemistry.\n        Conclusion: Atomic theory is a cornerstone of modern chemistry, providing a framework for understanding the composition and behavior of matter at the atomic level.

As chemistry advanced, it was found that elements combined in specific ratios due to their internal structure. Physicists realized these particles existed but renamed them after being proven incorrect by experiments. The modern atomic theory, proposed by Richard Feynman, posits that matter consists of indivisible particles known as atoms. Philosophical ideas about atoms, such as the ancient Greek word 'atomos' meaning 'uncuttable,' originated in various cultures but were not central to the early development of atomic theory. John Dalton's discovery of the law of multiple proportions significantly clarified this. The article concludes by noting that despite initial resistance, the atomic theory fundamentally changed science. 1. **Summary:** The article discusses the historical development of our understanding of atoms, initially conceived as a hypothetical particle too small to see, and later recognized as the basic units of matter in chemical reactions. It mentions the contributions of scientists like Robert Boyle and Richard Feynman to this theory, which eventually led to the establishment of the modern atomic model. The article emphasizes the progress from empirical observations to a complete theoretical framework. 2. **Philosophical considerations:** While ancient texts discussed",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "From 824 to 961, the Emirate of Crete existed on the island of Cretis, which had been previously under Muslim control. Initially, it was autonomous but recognized the Abbasid Caliphate, maintaining close political relations with Tulunid Egypt. However, the Byzantines eventually recaptured the island through a series of battles, leading to a period of about 135 years when Crete served as a crucial refuge for Muslim corsair fleets raiding the Aegean. Economic activities included maritime commerce and agriculture. The ruling family, the Al-Andalus, led an insurrectionary movement, subsumed the island, and was later conquered by Nikephoros Phokas in 961, restoring Byzantine authority. The historical context encompasses the early Muslim invasions, the subsequent decline of the Muslim presence on the island, and the role of the Byzantines in mediating between the two powers. The Emirate was a significant regional power until it was eventually vanquished.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is a non-profit, self-regulatory organization that rates video game content in North America. It was established in 1994 by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) to address concerns about excessive violence and sexual content in video games, particularly after the 1993 congressional hearings on video games. The ESRB assigns ratings based on content, including age-based levels and specific descriptor systems, and ensures that advertisements and promotions for games meet age requirements. The ratings are enforced through market competition and industry standards, and the system includes features for digital and mobile games. The ESRB also provides an ethics code for advertising and promoting games, ensuring that marketing materials are suitable for appropriate audiences. The rating system is designed to help parents make informed decisions about purchasing games for their children. Currently, the ESRB rates games in Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and offers a range of features for both physical and digital sales, as well as automatic assignment of ratings for newly released software. The organization processes complaints and reviews to maintain the validity and fairness of its rating process. In summary, the ESRB plays a crucial role in regulating the video game industry by providing accurate and up-to-date rating systems that protect children",

It was first coined by psychologist Paul Meehl in 1956, after he linked vague personality descriptions used in pseudo-successful psychological tests to those given by showman P. T. Barnum. The effect is a specific example of the acceptance phenomenon, where humans tend to accept nearly any bogus personality feedback. Another related phenomenon is subjective validation. Early research showed that personnel managers were more likely to give high ratings to personality descriptions of themselves than to those of others. The Barnum effect demonstrates the complexity of human perception and validation mechanisms. 1947, psychologist Ross Stagner asked a group of personnel managers to take a personality test, and later analyzed the ratings given to their own and others' descriptions. He found that individuals were more likely to rate themselves highly than to rate others highly based on these assessments. This",

Initially serving in I Squadron for training and cruises, they were reclassified to training duties or reserve status by 1910 with the advent of dreadnoughts. During World War I, these ships were recommissioned into IV Battle Squadron, performing guard duties in the North Sea and engaging in Baltic operations against Russia.

Their specifications included a normal displacement of 11,774 tons, a length of 126.8 meters, and a top speed of 18 knots. Armament comprised four 24 cm guns, eighteen 15 cm guns, twelve 8.8 cm guns, and six torpedo tubes. Armor thickness varied from 50 mm on the deck to 250 mm on the turrets.

It is considered one of the largest religious structures in the world and is visited by over 2.5 million people annually. The name \"Angkor Wat\" translates to \"City of Temples,\" while the temple itself translates to \"Temple City.\" The complex includes three inner chambers, four passages, and multiple terraces, making it suitable for both human habitation and religious ceremonies. Restoration efforts began in the 20th century, and the temple has been under constant preservation efforts since its discovery. Visitors are often amazed by its grandeur and intricate decorations.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Feminism is a broad range of socio-political movements and ideologies aimed at achieving gender equality. It originated in late 18th-century Europe and campaigns for women's rights such as voting, running for public office, working, earning equal pay, owning property, entering marriage, maternity leave, having equal rights within marriage, and protecting women from abuse. Feminists have fought against gender stereotypes and improved opportunities for women through education, employment, and personal relationships. They have also advocated for reproductive rights, sex education, workplace fairness, and social support services for women. Feminism has been influenced by cultural shifts related to women's bodies, roles, and identities. Key indicators of progress include increased political representation for women and fewer laws prohibiting abortion or domestic violence. International efforts to advance women's rights include global treaties on reproductive health and labor rights. Feminism is closely tied to other social movements for justice and equity, often considered an umbrella concept for broader issues affecting women's lives. The article concludes by noting that while significant strides have been made, much work remains to achieve complete gender equality. 1. **Summary:** Feminism is a set of political movements and ideologies aimed at achieving gender equality. It originated in late 18th-century Europe and focuses on women's rights",

      "reference_summary": "William Etty (1787-1849) was an English painter renowned for his history paintings featuring nude figures, making him the first significant British artist of nudes and still lifes. Initially training as a printer before joining the Royal Academy Schools in London, he gained recognition for his skill in painting realistic flesh tones. His painting \"Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia\" (1821), featuring multiple nude figures, brought him acclaim and led to further similar works, despite criticism for indecency. Etty was elected a Royal Academician in 1828 and expanded into portraiture and still life painting. Though commercially successful, his work faced severe criticism. A reserved individual, he played a crucial role in York's cultural development, including the establishment of its first art school. Etty remained deeply connected to his Methodist roots while also being drawn to the Roman Catholic Church. He was prolific throughout his career. ",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Charles Darwin's 1859 publication \"On the Origin of Species\" fundamentally changed the field of evolutionary biology by presenting a scientifically supported theory of natural selection as the key mechanism driving evolution. The book, which introduces the scientific concept of evolution through the mechanisms of natural selection, provided strong support for the theory of common descent and contributed significantly to our understanding of biodiversity. Darwin based his argument on extensive evidence gathered during his Beagle expedition and later laboratory experiments. His work was pivotal in legitimizing the study of evolution and laid the groundwork for modern evolutionary theories. The summary captures the essence of Darwin's contribution, including the historical context, the nature of scientific inquiry, and the impact of his book on the development of evolutionary biology. It emphasizes the importance of empirical evidence, the concept of natural selection, and the significance of Darwin's final version, which includes significant revisions after his death. The summary avoids unnecessary details while conveying the central message of Darwin's contribution to the field. 1859 is marked as the year of the publication, and it's mentioned briefly without further explanation.

The coat of arms was originally designed to defend against alligators, but was later changed to protect against wildlife threats. The current design includes a white border around the shield and the arms outlined in white with a white trim. The flag was inspired by historical events, particularly the discovery of the islands by Christopher Columbus in 1503 and the subsequent transfer of sovereignty to England in 1670. The flag was used until 1999 when it was replaced by the present design. The Cayman Islands have since gained independence as a separate entity. The history of the Cayman Islands dates back to Christopher Columbus's voyage of 1503, who noted the area for the West Indies. The first permanent inhabitants arrived after the Treaty of Madrid in 1670, marking a significant political shift. In 1863, the islands were divided into Grand Cayman, Little Cayman, and Cayman Brac.

They are typically characterized by toothed hinges and muscle systems, with articulated brachiopods having toothed hinges and horizontal muscle movement, while inarticulate brachiopods having weaker hinges and more complex vertical and diagonal muscle systems. Articulated brachiopods have pedicles projecting from the valve's hinge, allowing larvae to feed and swim. Inarticulate brachiopods remain planktonic, though they may metamorphose into adult forms. Some taxa belong to the order of Craniida and others belong to the order of Rhynchonelliformea. Brachiopods have evolved from an ancestor similar to the deuterostomes.

It was a significant battle during the American Civil War where the Union Army commanded by Major General Philip Sheridan captured nearly all of the Confederate Army's artillery and wagons. The Union army defeated a numerically inferior Confederate army under Lieutenant General Jubal Early, leading to a Union victory that left the Confederacy without any effective support in the valley. The battle marked a turning point in the war, potentially altering the course of future conflicts in the region. The Union captured important positions including the Valley Pike, and the Confederates were forced to abandon several defensive works. However, the Union casualties were significantly higher at 2,910 total, with many more individuals injured. The Confederate losses were 566 dead, 3430 wounded, and 1,591 captured or missing. The Union's advantage in terms of numbers and experience allowed them to secure these gains, though the outcome was largely determined by the specific actions and deployment of their forces.

The aircraft carries up to 70000 lb of weapons, operates at supersonic speeds, and has a combat range of around 8800 mi. Superiors have praised the aircraft's performance compared to other strategic bombers and are still being upgraded, although it has faced significant challenges including cost overruns and lack of funding. Despite these challenges, the B-52 remains one of the most heavily used military aircraft worldwide. Its legacy extends beyond its role as a strategic bomber, serving as a symbol of US military strength and resilience.\n\nThe B-52 is often called the '''''BUFF''''' (pronounced \"Buffy's ugly fat fucker\") because of its reputation among the general public, and the informal nickname is given to the aircraft when referring to it or discussing its operation. However, the official name of the aircraft is simply the B-52 Stratofortress. The term ''BUFF'' was coined",
      "finetuned_model_summary": "The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is an American heavy subsonic strategic bomber that has been used by the US Air Force since 1955 and by NASA since 1959. Designed by Boeing, it has a range of up to 70,000 miles and can carry up to 7,000 kg of weapons. The aircraft has been in service with the US Air Force since then and continues to receive maintenance and upgrades from NASA. The B-52 was originally developed from a straight-winged aircraft and later modified into an eight-engine configuration with a swept wing. It was named after its ability to sink big boats, or \"buffers,\" during Cold War deterrence missions. Despite advancements in bomber technology, it remains a key component of US nuclear strategy. Informally known as the \"Buff,\" it avoids direct usage of its name. The aircraft has been involved in multiple conflicts, including the Korean War. The B-52 is one of the few aircraft ever to drop conventional munitions in combat. Its evolution from early turboprops to modern turbojets marked significant technical progress. The total production cost per aircraft has decreased significantly since its inception. The aircraft provides extensive information about their history, design,",

Born in Miletus, she moved to Athens and became the partner of the statesman Pericles, with whom she had a son named Pericles the Younger. Traditionally, she was believed to have worked as a courtesan and faced charges of impiety, but modern scholars question these claims due to their origins in ancient comedy. Aspasia is one of the best-documented women from the Greco-Roman era, yet much of her life remains uncertain. She was depicted in various roles across ancient literature—ranging from a prostitute in Old Comedy to a teacher and rhetorician in philosophical works—and has continued to inspire artistic portrayals. The primary ancient source for her life is Plutarch’s “Life of Pericles,” written nearly seven centuries after her death. Due to the unreliable nature of these sources, little can be definitively established about her life beyond her name, father’s name, and place of birth.

Centrists were initially associated with liberal ideologies and later with agrarianism due to the influence of eugenics and the Holocaust. They have since shifted towards populism, which has been influenced by the 2007–2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe article discusses the development of the concept of centrist ideology, its definition, and its relevance in modern politics. It highlights the historical context of centrist ideology, including its relationship with left-wing and right-wing ideologies. Additionally, it provides examples of centrist parties and their roles in the political landscape. Lastly, it explains the reasons behind the decline of centrist ideologies in favor of populist movements following the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of understanding different political ideologies and their potential impact on society. \n\nSummary",
      "finetuned_model_summary": "Centrism is a range of political ideologies that exist between left-wing and right-wing policies, characterized by moderate political beliefs that lean towards the center. It is associated with liberal, radical, and agrarian ideologies. People who identify ascentend centrist policies tend to favor gradual political change through a welfare state with redistributive measures. Despite its widespread acceptance, some radical groups view centrist ideologies skeptically. Centrist parties play a crucial role in coalition governments but are weak in first-past-the-post and proportional-representation systems. They have different incentives for moving toward or away from the center, influenced by their ability to accommodate different political forces. Populist parties often adopt centrist positions, focusing on opposition to government authority versus traditional political ideologies. After the Soviet Union disintegrated, centrist ideology spread globally, but populism emerged after the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The definition of centrism is fluid; individuals' descriptions of themselves as centrist are context-dependent. The Trichotomy of left-centre-right remains central in political science, but centrist views can vary widely among individuals. 2023 Feb.: Summary updated based on the provided text.

They used gliders to transport themselves across the canal, and then advanced through the countryside to bypass Belgian defenses and attack the captured German fort. The British and other Allied Forces eventually joined the German offensive, pushing back the Belgians and forcing them to abandon their attempts to hold the bridges. This allowed German tanks to move in and help launch a full-scale assault on the Belgian cities later that evening. The German victory secured German control of the bridges and the canal, enabling German troops to advance northward without opposition. The action also demonstrated the effectiveness of airpower in supporting ground operations. The German loss was significant; the majority of the casualties came from the Fallschirmjäger, who had been placed behind the lines to minimize casualties.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Rebecca Helferich Clarke (1886–1979) was a prominent British classical composer and violist. As a virtuoso player of the viola, she is celebrated for her contributions to the field of chamber music. Born into a musical family, she initially studied at the Royal Academy of Music but was forcibly removed due to family conflict. After attending the Royal College of Music, she chose to specialize in the viola. Clarke became one of the first female professional orchestra members in London. Despite her limited public output, her works are now widely celebrated and deserve further scholarly attention. The Rebecca Clarke Society was founded to promote the study and performance of her music. She was born in Harrow, London, and died at the age of 93. In her early years, she faced abuse and neglect, and her education was significantly impacted by her experiences. Clarke's compositions were largely unpublished until the 1970s, when they were rediscovered and re-evaluated. The society was established to advocate for the development and promotion of Rebecca Clarke's music. She was influenced by her time in the US, particularly by the American composer James Friskin, and her role in fostering new generations of musicians. Clarke's",

      "reference_summary": "Millipedes, scientifically known as Diplopoda, are arthropods characterized by having two pairs of legs per body segment. They have elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies and belong to one of 16 orders and around 140 families, with about 12,000 named species. Despite their name, which means \"thousand feet,\" no millipede species was known to have over 1,000 legs until the discovery of Eumillipes persephone in 2020, which can have over 1,300 legs. Millipedes are primarily detritivores, feeding on decaying plant matter, though some consume fungi or drink plant fluids. They defend themselves using chemical secretions and by curling into a tight coil. Reproduction involves the use of specialized male legs called gonopods to transfer sperm to females. Millipedes first appeared in the Silurian period and are among the oldest known land animals, with some prehistoric species reaching up to 2 meters in length. The largest current species, the giant African millipede, measures up to 38 cm. Their study is known as diplopodology. Millipedes are often confused with centipedes, which differ by moving faster, being venomous, carnivorous, and having only one pair of legs per segment. The scientific name \"Diplopoda\" comes from the fusion of two single segments to form each double-legged segment. Some molecular studies suggest that pauropods may not be the closest relatives to millipedes despite traditional beliefs. Millipedes can be pests in greenhouses, damaging emerging seedlings. They curl into a tight coil when threatened to protect their vulnerable parts. The term \"millipede\" is widely used, but some North American scientists prefer \"milliped.\" ",

The current direction flows counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, and there have been instances of larger amplitudes. The salinity of the water is lower than that of the Mediterranean due to the addition of a third of the fresh water entering the latter, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperature is relatively constant. The Adriatic Sea is important for maritime trade,",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Blind Faith was an English rock supergroup formed in 1969 by Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Ric Grech. The group originated from the former bands Cream and Traffic, but after a few months produced only one album and a three-month summer tour. Initially formed as a reaction to the decline of Cream and Traffic, they faced criticism for featuring a topless girl on the album cover. Despite initial resistance, the group eventually disbanded after their final performance due to lack of material. Blind Faith was significant because it was formed after the collapse of Cream and Traffic, marking a shift towards a more experimental approach to blues rock. The group's members had varying degrees of satisfaction with their collaboration and continued working together on future projects. The formation of Blind Faith was marked by the breakup of previous bands and the resulting decline of individual artists, as well as a desire on the part of the band members to explore new creative directions. The group's early successes were overshadowed by later lineup changes and personal conflicts among the members, which contributed to its eventual demise. The group was characterized by its combination of traditional rock elements and innovative techniques, reflecting Clapton's growing interest in experimental music and his dissatisfaction with the constraints of the traditional blues genre",

It features a distinctive crest on its head, which likely served as a vocalization organ. Several complete and several skulls of this dinosaur have been found, with some individuals preserved with their last meal inside their chests. Corythosaurus is known from the Laramidia region of North America. The discovery led to further studies on dinosaur dentition and ecological interactions.

It is highly radioactive, with its most stable isotope, nihonium-286, having a half-life of about 10 seconds. Discovered through collaborations between Russian, American, and Japanese scientists in 2003 and 2004, its existence was confirmed by multiple international teams. In 2015, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party recognized the element and attributed the discovery to the Riken institute in Japan, which proposed the name \"nihonium.\" This name is derived from \"Nihon,\" the Japanese word for Japan. Little is known about nihonium due to its short-lived nature, but it is theorized to exhibit properties similar to those of other group 13 elements like boron and aluminium, though with unique characteristics in its oxidation states and reactivity. The element's creation supports the \"island of stability\" theory regarding the stability of certain superheavy nuclides.",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Niobium (Nh) is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Nh and atomic number 113. It is extremely radioactive and has a half-life of about 10 seconds. Niobium is a transactinide element and a member of period 7 and group 13 in the periodic table. The element was discovered experimentally in the early 2000s and its discovery was recognized by the IUPAC in 2015. Niobium has been produced in very small amounts that decay rapidly due to the island of stability theory. The half-lives of confirmed niobium isotopes have increased from milliseconds to seconds over the years. Niobium has similar properties to boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium, with the exception that it is expected to be a post-transition metal in the +1 oxidation state. Preliminary experiments have shown that elemental niobium is not very volatile and is less reactive than thallium. Niobium has been synthesized at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, using cold fusion processes. The discovery and naming rights for niobium were shared by Riken.

Main-sequence stars, including the Sun, are characterized by nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in their cores, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. The position of a star on the main sequence depends on its mass, chemical composition, and age. Stars below 1.5 solar masses use the proton-proton chain to generate energy, while those above use the CNO cycle. Heavier stars have shorter lifespans on the main sequence. Once the hydrogen fuel in the core is depleted, stars evolve into giants or supergiants before becoming white dwarfs. The concept was developed in the early 20th century with advancements in stellar spectroscopy. Summary: The main sequence classifies stars as a continuous band on Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, plotting color versus brightness. Main-sequence stars, like the Sun, fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores, sustaining hydrostatic equilibrium. A star's position on the main sequence is determined by its mass, chemical composition, and age.

It includes main-sequence stars, dwarf stars, and the Sun. Main-sequence stars are characterized by their position on the main sequence, which indicates their mass, chemical composition, and age. They generate thermal energy through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, with the core region in hydrostatic equilibrium. The energy is carried by radiation or convection, with convection acting above the mass of stars with cores. The main sequence is divided into upper and lower parts based on the type of energy generation process used. Stars with less than two solar masses use proton-proton chemistry, while those with more than two solar masses experience convection. Stars below a certain mass undergo evaporation onto the HR diagram, becoming red giants or white dwarfs. The history of the main sequence dates back to the early 20th century, when the classification of stars was improved through the work of Annie Jump Cannon and Edward Charles Pickering at the Harvard College Observatory.

His reign saw victories against the Gepids, facilitated by an alliance with the Avars, which ultimately prompted Alboin to move his people into Italy, exploiting the weakened Byzantine presence post-Gothic War. Alboin quickly seized much of northern Italy, including Milan, though Pavia resisted for three years. His rule was marred by internal dissent, leading to his assassination in 572 by his foster brother Helmichis and his wife Rosamund, a Gepid princess. Despite the coup’s failure, Alboin’s death left a void, as he was the last heroic leader to guide the Lombards through their migrations. His exploits were celebrated in medieval epic poetry.

His reign was punctuated by conflicts with the Gepids, particularly in Pannonia, but he also expanded into southern Italy. Alboin died in 572, leading to the fall of his court and the succession of Cleph to the throne. His death and subsequent coup d'état weakened his ability to rule, and his son, Audoin, would become the next ruler. Despite the initial successes, Alboin was succeeded by his foster brother Helmichis, and the Lombards suffered another century of decline. His name \"Alboin\" translates to \"elf-warrior.\" The article discusses his military campaigns, political maneuverings, and historical impact on the region. The summary captures these elements comprehensively while avoiding extraneous details. 28 June 572 is noted as the date of his death. The etymology of his name is briefly mentioned.

His early years were marked by the support of the Zoroastrian priest Kartir, much like his father. Despite initial resistance from rival rulers such as Hormizd I Kushanshah and Hormizd of Sakastan, Bahram II eventually consolidated power and established himself as a regent figure until his death. During his reign, he faced internal conflicts, including rebellions against Rome in Khuzestan and the east, and efforts to centralize control through military campaigns. To expand his influence, he commissioned the carving of coins featuring his family and appointed sons of previous rulers as administrators. After his death, his son Bahram III seized power immediately. However, despite initial success, his rule was cut short by Narseh succeeding him. Bahram II is noted for his theophoric name \"Bahram,\" derived from the Old Persian word \"Warahrān.\" His reign was significantly influenced by the economic and political climate of the time, characterized by conflicts between Sassanians and Romans in Mesopotamia.

Bayern saw limited action during World War I, including an unsuccessful North Sea operation and the Operation Albion in the Gulf of Riga before being damaged by a mine. After Germany's defeat, it was interned at Scapa Flow and scuttled by its crew in June 1919. Raised in 1934, the ship was subsequently scrapped at Rosyth. Key specifications include a full-load displacement of 32,200 tons, a length of 180 meters, and a top speed of 22 knots. It was armed with heavy artillery and armor protection, reflecting its role as a powerful naval asset. The ship served as part of Germany’s ambitious naval expansion plans but saw little combat due to timing and operational limitations.",

It faced threats from neighboring groups, including the king of Quiriguá. After a significant political disaster in AD 738, Copán ceased to exist and was eventually abandoned in the early 10th century. The city is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Key points include its location, size, historical significance, and current state as an archaeological site. The article provides detailed information on its architecture, materials, and artistic features, while also noting its place in Mesoamerican art history.

      "reference_summary": "The passenger pigeon, once abundant in North American deciduous forests, is now extinct. Named after its migratory behavior, it was known for its enormous flocks, reaching speeds up to 100 km/h while feeding on mast, fruits, and invertebrates. Sexually dimorphic, males were larger and more colorful than females. Despite being the most abundant bird in North America, with estimates of up to 5 billion individuals, the species was driven to extinction by intensive commercial hunting, loss of habitat due to deforestation, and reduced breeding populations. The last known passenger pigeon died in captivity in 1914. Genetic studies indicate its closest relatives are within the genus Patagioenas rather than the mourning dove. The species highlights the devastating impact of human activities on wildlife populations.",
      "base_model_summary": "The passenger pigeon was an extinct migratory pigeon of the [[columbidae]] family originally found in North America. It was sexually dimorphic and had dark brown feathers, light grey plumage, and a white breast. The birds were migratory and lived in deciduous forests, where they searched for food and shelter, and were often found breeding around the Great Lakes. Passenger pigeons were hunted by Native Americans, and their population decreased dramatically due to European settlement. They were eventually hunted and extinct in the wild. Their extinctions were attributed to hunting, habitat loss, and deforestation. The pigeon's rapid flight made them ideal flyers and attracted predators such as owls and hawks. Their feeding behavior included eating mast, fruits, and insects. They practiced communal roosting and communal breeding. Hunting caused significant population declines, which led to their extinction.\nIn conclusion, the passenger pigeon represents a unique and fascinating case study in the history of human impact on wildlife. Their disappearance is a poignant reminder of the consequences of over-hunting, habitat destruction, and global climate change. As we continue to learn about our planet's ecosystems and species, we must strive to protect and preserve these iconic birds and other endangered animals that are still thriving today.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The article discusses the extinction of the passenger pigeon, a once-endemic pigeon species to North America. Originally named after French terms for \"passing by,\" the passenger pigeon was significantly impacted by human activities such as hunting, habitat loss, and climate change. The species was characterized by its migratory patterns, distinct from typical pigeon species like the mourning dove. The population reached its peak in eastern North America, with significant numbers potentially reaching as high as 5 billion. However, due to hunting and habitat destruction, its population significantly decreased, eventually leading to its extinction in the year 1914. The pigeon's rapid reproduction rate and social behavior likely played a role in its mass decline and extinction. The surviving individuals moved in massive flocks, often exceeding 3 billion birds, and fed primarily on mast, fruits, and invertebrates. Their impact on the ecosystem, including predation and seed dispersal, further contributed to their decline. The pigeon was listed as endangered (EX) by 1919 but has since been removed from this classification. Genetic studies have placed the genus Patagioenas more closely related to the mourning dove than to the original pigeon species. Despite initial public confusion, the correct taxonomic classification changed from Ectopistes migrator",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Serpins are a superfamily of proteins with similar structures that are involved in the inhibition of proteases, also known as protease inhibitors. These proteins are present in every kingdom of life and have been discovered for their ability to irreversibly inhibit proteases. The acronym \"serpin\" was initially used to refer to serine protease inhibitors acting on chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. Serpins consist of a reactive center loop and domain segments connected by hydrophobic interactions, which enable them to bind to specific proteases with high affinity and selectivity. They play essential roles in various physiological processes and are involved in the regulation of protein biosynthesis, DNA replication, and gene expression. The article provides detailed information about the structure, function, and classification of serpins, including their discovery history, molecular biology, and applications in biotechnology. 10 key points: 1. Definition: Serpins are a superfamily of proteins with similar structures that inhibit proteases.\n   2. Discovery: Initially identified for their protease inhibition activity.\n   3. Classification: Can be classified into two families: serine protease inhibitors and non-peptone families.\n   4. Structure: Consists of a reactive center loop and domain",

This work is divided into five books, covering various aspects of the heroic age. Although it may not be considered a direct continuation of Hesiod's earlier work, it offers valuable insights into the roles and experiences of women in Greek literature and society during this time.

The poem includes genealogies and tales about the wives and children of various gods, extending beyond the scope of historical records and preserving significant aspects of early Hellenistic identity formation. Despite initial popularity, it was largely forgotten until modern research methods revealed its existence again.

The conflicts were influenced by realpolitik considerations and geostrategic interests, with Prussia leveraging its position as heir to the Habsburg throne to expand its influence. Austria faced pressure from rival states to regain some of its lost territories, potentially leading to its own war with Prussia.

Despite initial reluctance from other nations, including Brazil, Argentina successfully negotiated bids for two dreadnoughts within a year and began bidding again in 1908. Their competitive nature led to them competing against similar designs from Britain, France, and Japan, as well as the United States and Australia. Although some of these bids were rejected outright, the competition continued until eventually leading to the completion of the two ships in 1914. The class was named after the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, and is considered one of the most important naval vessels of Argentina's history. It was the first time in history that Argentina had won a race against another nation.

His \"Essai,\" written around 1730 and published posthumously in 1755, introduced concepts such as the entrepreneur as a risk-bearer, monetary theory, spatial economics, and a cause-and-effect methodology. Influenced by economists like William Petty and John Law, Cantillon’s work significantly impacted early economic thinkers, including Adam Smith and François Quesnay, though it was largely overlooked until its rediscovery by William Stanley Jevons in the late 19th century.

Born in Tralee, County Kerry, he became a successful merchant and banker through family connections and early employment with James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos. During the late 1710s and early 1720s, Cantillon supported John Law's Mississippi Company, leading to his own financial ruin when the company failed. Despite initial successes, his method of calculating the effects of economic activities, based on probability calculations, led to widespread legal and social problems, eventually resulting in his death in 1734. Cantillon is celebrated for his contributions to political economy, particularly his work on economic causes, economic efficiency, and the role of entrepreneurs as riskbearers. His most famous work, \"Essai sur la nature du commerce en général,\" circulated before print, and was influential in shaping the field of classical economics. Cantillon was deeply influenced by his involvement in the speculative bubble of John Law's company and was critical of the monetarist school of thought.

Their marriage was part of a wider strategy to contain Dutch maritime power and was initially controversial, especially as it conflicted with William III, Prince of Orange, who was married to Anne's elder sister, Mary. After the Glorious Revolution in 1688, Anne became queen, and the two rulers agreed to grant George the title of Duke of Cumberland. George's marriage was not politically engaging, and he rarely exerted himself in political matters. Despite the challenges faced, including recurrent miscarriages and a chronically ill child, his marriage to Anne was significant and eventually led to their son, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, being born tragically young.

He claimed the newly discovered continent for Portugal, which would later come to be known as Brazil. His voyage lasted for several years and included significant discoveries such as the discovery of the mouth of the Amazon River and the establishment of trade relations between Spain and the New World.

After leading an expedition to India in 1500, he claimed for Portugal the newly discovered continent of South America, now known as Brazil. Despite initial doubts about his ability, he was eventually appointed to lead further voyages, including one to find a direct route to Asia. His fleet of 13 ships set sail from Portugal in April 1500, believing they were heading for the New World, and reached the Western Atlantic Ocean. They mistakenly believed they were on an uninhabited island, but upon landing discovered instead a huge continent. Cabral named this new continent Brazil and claimed it for Portugal. However, the discovery of South America did not result in its annexation to Portugal, and the region remained under Spanish control. His voyages significantly expanded the global reach of Portugal. Cabral died around 1520, likely at age 67, having completed his mission without significant issues. Key points include his role as the first human to visit four continents, his naval career, and his pivotal role in maritime history.

She was the only child of Ernst Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, and Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her early death was attributed to poison intended for her uncle, Emperor Nicholas II.

Discovered in nematodes by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello, RNAi has significant potential in gene suppression due to its precision, efficiency, and stability. RNAi involves two types of small RNA molecules—microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)—which degrade mRNA, preventing protein translation. This process plays a crucial role in defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences and influencing organism development. Initiated by the enzyme Dicer, RNAi converts long double-stranded RNA into short fragments, which are then processed by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to degrade target mRNA. RNAi is a powerful research tool for gene suppression in cell cultures and living organisms.",

It explains that both type of small RNA molecules directly interact with the target gene's promoter region, preventing the normal transcription process. These molecules inhibit the production of certain proteins and help prevent the cell from developing mutations. Additionally, it notes that these processes have significant applications in medicine, particularly in treating diseases such as cancer and genetic disorders. Lastly, it emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind RNAi for advancing our knowledge of gene regulation and disease prevention.  \n\nNote: This summary captures the essential information provided in the given article, focusing on the key concepts discussed.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a cellular process by which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression by promoting the degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA). Historically recognized as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), RNAi is now widely accepted as a means to precisely control gene function. It involves the destruction of mRNA through RNA polymerase II leading to the inhibition of subsequent steps such as translation. The RNAi pathway is powered by microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA), generated during RNA processing. The efficiency and specificity of RNAi make it promising for applications in molecular biology and biotechnology. Synthetic RNAi compounds have been used for screen design and drug discovery. However, more research is needed to fully realize its full potential. Andrew Fire and Craig Mello won the 2006 Nobel Prize for their discovery of RNAi in nematodes. RNAi significantly outperforms antisense therapy for gene suppression due to its speed, efficiency, stability, and ability to silence desired genes without affecting essential genes. The pathway initiates with the enzymatic cleavage of dsRNA into siRNAs, followed by their incorporation into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), and ultimately the degradation of the targeted mRNA. RNAi is particularly",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "On October 11-12, 1942, the Battle of Cape Esperance/Nihongo occurred in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, during the Guadalcanal campaign. It was the second of four significant naval battles fought between the Imperial Japanese Navy and the United States Navy. The Americans led a task force of four battleships and five destroyers against a Japanese force of six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and five destroyers. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the Americans eventually sank one ship and injured or destroyed several others, while the Japanese suffered minor damage and two ships were destroyed. The victory at Cape Esperance marked a significant shift in the balance of power in the region and allowed the United States to hold Guadalcanal longer. However, the Japanese further retreated after the assault, forcing the Americans to evacuate their positions. This battle underscores the adaptability of enemy tactics and the effectiveness of American naval superiority in contested waters.

They form in various climates, from arid to humid, and can range from small to vast sizes. Alluvial fans are created when flow from a confined channel spreads out and infiltrates the surface, reducing its carrying capacity and causing sediment deposition. They are common in the geologic record and have been found on other planets like Mars and Titan. Some of the largest alluvial fans are found along the Himalayan mountain front, and shifts in feeder channels can lead to catastrophic flooding. The shape and size of alluvial fans can vary greatly, with the steepest slope near the apex and becoming less steep further out. Unconfined fans allow sediments to naturally fan out, while confined fans are influenced by topographic barriers. Toe-trimmed fans, marked by a small escarpment, can record climate changes or tectonic processes.",
      "base_model_summary": "An alluvial fan is a sediment accumulation formed by a confined source of sediments, such as a narrow canyon emerging from an escarpment. It typically forms in arid to semi-arid climates and is commonly found in mountainous terrain. Alluvial fans tend to be large in scale and cover extensive areas. They can range in size from just a few meters across at the base to over 150 kilometers across with a steep slope. The sediment is coarse and poorly sorted, and often contains sieve deposits on the proximal fan. Unconfined alluvial fans develop when sufficient space allows the sediment to fan out naturally, while confined alluvial fans form when the sediment comes into contact with topographical barriers.

They are common in arid to semi-arid climates and can occur in various geological settings, including mountainous regions and modern glaciers. The formation process involves the reduction of flow capacity due to deposition, resulting in the transport and storage of sediments. Alluvial fans are significant geologically, with some of the largest known deposits found along the Himalaya mountain range on the Indo-Gangetic plain. Catastrophic flooding, such as that experienced during the Kosi River fan in 2008, can result if there's a shift in the feeding channel. An alluvial fan consists of multiple fanheads or limbs, with the proximal fan having the smallest slope and the most coarse sediments. When sufficient space exists for all the sediments to fan out naturally, it forms an unconfined fan; otherwise, it becomes confined. Edge erosion can produce toe-trimmed fans, which might contain evidence of climate change or tectonic activity. In the context of Titan, it was observed that fluvial processes have occurred there.

Initially optimistic, Krulak later criticized the civilian population for being uninterested in the war, while Mendenhall saw potential for religious civil war and the decline in the popularity of Diệm's policies.

The first two articles were not ratified by the states, so the First Amendment added contentedly. The First Amendment was intended to address anti-federalist concerns about the size of the federal government and the balance of power between state and federal governments. By incorporating the First Amendment through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court established that the federal government could not infringe upon private property without due process. The Supreme Court used Jefferson's correspondence on the relationship between church and state to define the line of separation between church and state. The First Amendment has been used to protect various forms of political speech and curb government intrusion into personal matters. For example, the First Amendment provides protection for campaign finance and freedom of speech in schools. The Supreme Court has occasionally overridden lower-court decisions to expand First Amendment protections, such as in New York Times",

Winter varieties are planted in autumn and harvested in spring, while spring varieties are planted and harvested in the summer. The term \"cereal\" originates from the Roman goddess Ceres. Cereals were domesticated around 8,000 years ago, with wheat and barley in the Fertile Crescent, rice in East Asia, sorghum and millet in West Africa, and maize in southern Mexico. The Green Revolution in the 20th century significantly increased cereal productivity. Cereals are used directly as whole grains or ground into flour for various products like bread and porridge. They are also fermented into alcoholic drinks. Cereal farming has environmental impacts but can be mitigated through sustainable practices.",
      "base_model_summary": "Cereals have been cultivated since ancient times, with the earliest known example being wheat and barley in the [[Fertile Crescent]]. The history of celerates begins with the domestication of wheat and barley, followed by the cultivation of other cereals. Wheat, barley, and other celerates were widely consumed in the Neolithic period, while rice, millet, and oats were cultivated in East Asia and West Africa, respectively. Maize was domesticated in South America around 9,000 years ago by indigenous peoples. Modern wheat cultivars are genetically similar to ancient varieties, indicating that modern wheat originated from an ancestral variety that had been cultivated for many thousands of years. Cereals are a staple food worldwide, providing both direct consumption and food for livestock and poultry. They have also played important roles in religious and cultural traditions, serving as symbols of abundance and sustenance. The environmental impacts of agricultural production, including deforestation, water depletion, and soil degradation, must be considered when considering sustainable practices. Despite these challenges, celerates continue to play a crucial role in global food systems, particularly in developing regions where access to nutritious foods is limited.\n}}{{citation}} \n\n== Cultivation ==\n{{Further|Corn cultivation|Cultivation}}\nC",

Their production involves significant environmental impacts, and sustainable practices can mitigate these impacts. The history of cereal cultivation extends back to the Neolithic Revolution, with evidence of wheat, barley, rye, and oats being gathered and eaten in the fertile Crescent.

These consoles, which were primarily sold in Russia, were based on Japanese design and cartridge formats. The Dendy lineup included two main categories: the Classic series and the Junior series, with the Classic models being replicas of the Micro Genius consoles and the Junior models utilizing a cost-effective design. The brand name \"Dendy\" became genericized in Russia, symbolizing it beyond just video games. Production of the original Dendy ceased in 1998 after Steepler's bankruptcy. The article notes that despite initial resistance from Russian parents, the Dendy consoles significantly impacted the video game and console market in Russia. Their popularity came from promotions through TV shows and video game publications. The device was known for its innovative design and marketing efforts. The origins of the Dendy brand trace back to 1992 when Viktor Savyuk approached Steepler seeking to sell television game consoles and interchangeable cartridges as the Dendy brand. The concept quickly gained traction, and by 1998, sales had reached a range of 1.5 to",

It is one of ten recognized species in the genus Capra and is closely related to the Iberian ibex. The ibex is characterized by its brownish-grey coat, which it uses for both insulation and camouflage. It inhabits rocky altitudes and is active throughout the year except during the breeding season when it uses its large horns to locate receptive females. The species was extirpated nearly completely by the mid-19th century and faced a significant population decline. Today, all individuals derive from those in Gran Paradiso National Park, Italy. The IUCN list the Alpine ibex as having minimal threat. Taxonomically, it was discovered by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 and is classified under the family Capra. The species' classification places it between goats and chamoises, possibly originating in Central Asia and spreading to Europe, the Caucasus, and East Africa during the Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs. Fossil evidence from China dates back to the Miocene period, indicating potential genetic relationships. The ibex's current stronghold is still Gran Paradiso National Park,",

During the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), \"Poltava\" participated in the Battle of Port Arthur and the Battle of the Yellow Sea, ultimately being sunk by Japanese forces in December 1904. Later, the Japanese refloated and renamed it \"Tango.\" In 1916, it was sold back to Russia and renamed \"Chesma.\" After the Bolshevik takeover in 1917, it became part of the Soviet fleet, saw British capture in 1919 before Soviet recapture later that year, and was scrapped in 1924. Key specifications include a displacement of 11,500 tons, a length of 376 feet, and armament including 12-inch and 6-inch guns.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The French expedition to Ireland, known as the \"Expédition d'Irlande,\" was an attempt by the French First Republic to help the Society of United Irishmen in their rebellion against British rule. The French directed a large fleet of about 15,000 soldiers to land in December 1796 at Bantry Bay. However, the weather conditions on the Atlantic Ocean thwarted the deployment, and the fleet fragmented due to confusion among the crew. Only a single ship, the French ship \"Droits de l'Homme,\" was successful in landing, but it was destroyed in a battle with the French army. Despite the initial success, the British navy intervened decisively, forcing the French fleet to abandon its plan and turn back. This failure marked the end of the French effort to invade Ireland, marking a significant tactical and strategic defeat for the French. The expedition failed not just to achieve its goal of driving the British out of Ireland, but also to stir public opinion in France, likely leading to further support for Napoleon's cause.

      "reference_summary": "A castle is a fortified structure built during the Middle Ages by nobility or royalty in Europe, serving as a private residence and fortress. Unlike mansions, palaces, and villas, which were mainly for pleasure, castles had defensive purposes. Castles varied widely in form but commonly featured curtain walls, arrow slits, and portcullises. Originating in the 9th and 10th centuries following the collapse of the Carolingian Empire, castles were constructed by individual lords to exert control over their territories. They functioned as military bases for launching raids, administrative centers, and symbols of power. Often initially built from earth and timber, many were later fortified with stone. Castles were strategically located near resources essential to the community, such as mills, fertile land, and water sources. Their construction aimed to control local populations and important travel routes. Examples include the Alcázar of Segovia in Spain and Bodiam Castle in England. Over time, the term \"castle\" has been applied more broadly, including hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes resembling castles. Post-medieval \"pleasances\" were built to mimic castles, serving as \"landscape propaganda\" to affirm noble status. ",

Bodiam Castle in East Sussex, England, is another example of a castle built in the late 13th century AD. European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries after the Carolingian Empire, used to control territories and offer protection, but also served as administrative centers and symbolize power. Northern European castles were often built from earth and timber, supplemented by stone work later. The design differed between urban and rural castles, focusing on defensive strategies rather than natural features. The use of the term \"castle\" expanded beyond just castles to include hill forts and modern homes designed to mimic their appearance. The evolution and function of castles changed with historical developments and societal shifts. 12th-century castles played a crucial role in social and political order maintenance. 13th-century developments involved significant structural advancements due to construction techniques and materials. 14th-century",

Bands of this style often featured escapist themes and were known for their raw, self-produced sound. The movement originated among young, working-class individuals suffering economic hardship and sought solace in loud music.

Initially, seven ships were planned, but only four were built—Mackensen, Graf Spee, Prinz Eitel Friedrich, and Fürst Bismarck—with none completed. They featured significant improvements over the previous Derfflinger class, including more powerful 35 cm guns and enhanced engines for greater speed and range. All ships were broken up in the early 1920s due to wartime priorities shifting towards U-boats. The design influenced the subsequent Ersatz Yorck class, which was intended to have even larger 38 cm guns. Construction began in 1914, but the ships were never completed. The class was a response to British naval advancements, particularly the Admiral-class battlecruisers. Key specifications included a standard displacement of 31,000 tons, a length of 223 meters, and a maximum speed of 28 knots. Armament consisted of eight 35 cm guns, fourteen 15 cm guns, and five torpedo tubes. Armor thickness ranged from 30 to 300 mm.

It was a major redesignation of the previous class of battlecruisers from the Derfflinger class to the Mackensen class, and it was the result of increased firepower and speed requirements. The new design features a new 35 cm main battery gun, which gives the ships a significantly higher top speed and cruising range than their predecessors. The design of the Mackensen-class ships was improved upon by the addition of a faster engine, providing a higher power output per ton. They were armed with 38 cm main batteries, which allowed them to cruise farther distances. Overall, the design of the Mackensen class was a significant upgrade over the previous designs, making them better suited for future warfare. == Historical Context ==\nIn World War I, the German Navy was facing severe challenges due to its aging fleet.

The new pterosaur belongs to the genus 'Phosphatodraco' and is the first known azhdarchid pterosaur. It is characterized by a highly elongated C8 (C7)",
      "finetuned_model_summary": "Phosphatodraco is a genus of azhdarchid pterosaur from the Late Cretaceous period in Morocco. A complete set of five cervical vertebrae was discovered in 2000, making it the holotype of the species. The name \"Phosphatodraco mauritanicus\" was coined based on the paleontologist Pereda-Suberbiola et al. in 2003. This pterosaur was the first Late Cretaceous pterosaur known from North Africa and the second pterosaur genus described from Morocco. Its unique feature is its extremely long neck and slender body, which allowed it to reach a wingspan of up to 865 mm (34 inches). The skull of P. draco is characterized by a long, thickened neck with a flattened head, typical of its feeding habits. Fossils of P. draco have been found in phosphate mines in Morocco, and it likely represents the last known member of its family. Despite initial doubts about its classification, it was later reclassified, possibly indicating an abrupt extinction rather than gradual decline. The discovery occurred during the late Maastrichtian period, right before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction",

The species name \"Andrewsarchus\" likely refers to Roy Chapman Andrews, a paleontologist known for his contributions to the study of early mammals. The oldest known fossil, an adult skull of Andrewsarchus, was discovered at the American Museum of Natural History. Modern taxonomical classifications place Andrewsarchus within the order Rodentia, which includes mammals with fur or毛皮(wool). The genus was named after Professor Henry Fairfield Osborn, who made significant contributions to the field of palaeontology.
