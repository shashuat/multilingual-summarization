It feeds primarily on smaller sharks, bony fish, and crabs, while occasionally being captured by suction. The species is considered rare due to human consumption and commercial fishing practices. Overfishing has led to its decline in recent decades, with populations currently estimated to have decreased by more than 70% since the 18th century. This species is also often mistaken for the spiny shark (''E. cookei''), although they are not related genetically.

Occurring during the final evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, supernovae leave behind neutron stars or black holes. The last naked-eye supernova observed in our galaxy was Kepler's Supernova in 1604; the most recent one visible without a telescope was SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Supernovae are primarily caused by two mechanisms: re-ignition of nuclear fusion in white dwarfs or gravitational collapse of massive stars' cores. These events expel vast amounts of material into space, enriching the interstellar medium with elements crucial for star formation and contributing to cosmic rays and possibly gravitational waves. The term \"supernova\" was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s to distinguish these phenomena from less luminous novae.

The first supernova directly observed in the Milky Way was a blue supergiant star explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud, suggesting they occur on average about three times every century.

It highlights the role of white dwarfs and massive stars in triggering supernovae and provides insights into how these explosions affect the composition of the interstellar medium and cosmic rays.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "A supernova is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion that occurs during the last stages of a massive star's evolution. Initially a star collapses to form a neutron star or black hole, or is entirely destroyed to create a diffuse nebula. The peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months. The last supernova directly observed in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, followed by numerous others throughout history. Observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest their occurrence every three years on average. Most supernovae are triggered by the re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a white dwarf or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. Supernovae expel solar masses of material at speeds up to several percent of the speed of light, which drives an expanding shock wave into the interstellar medium, sweeping up a shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant. Supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium, contributing to the expansion of the universe and producing gravitational waves.

Nine British soldiers, including Captain Thomas Preston, shot five Americans while they were harassed and verbally abusive. These actions were later characterized as a massacre by prominent Patriots like Samuel Adams and Paul Revere. The incident drew significant media attention, with images and descriptions later used by the US government to promote independence. The British, seeing an opportunity for revenge, fired their weapons into the air before Preston and the others retreated, which led to their acquittal on charges of manslaughter. In response, the Massachusetts General Court fined Preston and the others $50 each.  This act marked the beginning of widespread fear among Boston's white population towards any perceived threat from the British.

This property is fundamental and appears in various areas of algebra. For example, in arithmetic, 1 = 4 + 3 = 3 + 4, and in algebra, the multiplication of polynomials is commutative. Operations like division and subtraction are noncommutative, while exponents are anti-commutative. The term \"commutative\" in this context comes from the need to prove properties about these operations without assuming their noncommutative nature. The 19th century saw the formalization of this concept, although the term itself did not exist until then. Mathematical examples include addition, multiplication, vector spaces, sets, and logical operations like AND and OR. These operations are commutative in most number systems and fields, while subtraction and exponentiation are noncommutative. Division, however, is noncommutative due to the definition of anticommutativity.  {{Krowne, p.1}}  {{Weisstein, ''Commute'', p. 1}}  {{Krowne, p.1}}  {{Flood11}}  {{Krowne, p.",

It occurs in diverse forms, from vertebrates and invertebrates, fungi, microorganisms, and even some insects. Key processes involve luciferin and luciferase, where luciferins produce excited states of luciferin, leading to luminescence. This can occur through bioluminescence, phlogiston, or autoionization of organic compounds. In some cases, luciferase needs cofactors like calcium or magnesium ions, while in others, it's solely catalytic oxidation. Evolutionarily, many bioluminescent enzymes have remained largely unchanged over time, with some lampreys belonging to 11 phyla. Bioluminescence is widespread across various animal groups, particularly in marine environments. Its applications include counterillumination, mimicry, and signaling within species, and research is ongoing on its use in artificial lighting and biofuels.

The revolt, part of the larger Glorious Revolution, led to the dissolution of the Dominion and the reinstatement of previous colonial governments. Andros's unpopularity stemmed from his enforcement of the Navigation Acts, denial of land titles, restrictions on town meetings, and promotion of the Church of England, which angered Puritans. The successful revolt allowed the former Massachusetts Bay Colony leaders to reclaim control without any casualties.

However, despite these informal exchanges, truces were not as extensive as during the war's earlier phases. These truces were particularly notable during the holiday season, symbolizing a time when soldiers could pause for a moment of warmth and understanding. Despite this, they were generally brief, lasting only until daybreak. The truces also served an educational purpose, helping soldiers to forget about their previous tense interactions with each other. As years passed, the nature of these truces changed, becoming more formal and less spontaneous.  The truces were influenced by the prevailing atmosphere of \"live and let live,\" where soldiers could engage in small talks without fear of reprisals. Although their impact is sometimes overlooked, these truces remain a significant aspect of World War I, especially in comparison to their wartime intensity.  Additionally, the truces provided a chance for soldiers to recuperate from their long days of service and relax before facing future combat.  Overall, the",

Both countries were mediating between themselves due to their disagreement over the border. Initially, tensions were high, especially after a 1974 clash where both sides accused each other of provoking the other. In 1983, Burkinabé President Thomas Sankara and Malian President Moussa Traoré agreed to have the border issue resolved through the International Court of Justice. However, progress was slow, leading to a 1985 war where Mali used military force to encroach on the Agacher Strip, resulting in significant casualties for both sides. Despite this, a ceasefire was reached on December 30, leading to a peaceful resolution of the border issue. This war significantly tarnished the political images of both countries, contributing to their respective economies.

Her husband, Prasutagus, had two sons, named after him, and ruled them as a nominal ally of Rome. However, when Prasutagus died, his will was ignored, and the kingdom was annexed. Boudica led a rebellion and destroyed Camulodunum, killing several Roman soldiers. As a result, many Britons were killed, including herself. Boudica died by suicide or illness during the revolt, which ended with the Romans' victory. Her story is celebrated in English literature and has become a symbol of British national independence. Her cause was revived during the English Renaissance and later became a cultural symbol in Britain. There are several ancient sources, such as Tacitus' \"Annales,\" which provide detailed information about the events leading up to and during the revolt.

It was intended to replace the Bismarck-class battleships, which were under construction by Germany. The original plan called for 15 ships total, but due to budget cuts and resource limitations, only four were constructed. These four were the only four hulls that ever saw the water, and their construction was plagued by numerous issues including structural weakness due to poor construction techniques and the lack of suitable armor material. Despite this, the ships could still serve as training facilities and as supplies carriers. The project was terminated after World War II.  The four hulls were scrapped during World War II, and none of the remaining seven battleships were used until later in the Cold War.  The class was a significant departure from previous Soviet naval designs, with its reliance on outdated technology and limited resources.  The term 'Sovetsky Soyuz' remains an unofficial designation given to this specific class.  Construction costs were high, and the resulting vessels were of poor quality.

His reign is uncertain and subject to debate, although he is generally considered the best-attested ruler of the period. There are three major theories regarding his dynasty: one based on Salitis, another on Khyan and Apophis, and the third on a vassal relationship. From archaeological evidence, many scarabid seals bear his name across various regions, suggesting a significant influence of the Hyksos during his time. However, the exact nature of his status or dynasty remains under investigation. He ruled approximately from c. 1800 BC to 1550 BC. Key points include his connection to the Hyksos, his tenure as a ruler of the Fourth Dynasty, and his likely influence over Canaanites and Phoenicians. The article also touches on his predecessor Ammu Aahotepre and successor Nehesy, noting their roles in his reign.

Initially, atoms were thought of as hypothetical particles too small to be seen, then renamed as basic particles of chemical elements, and further studied as complex systems with internal structures. Atomic theory is one of the most important scientific developments in history, essential for all physical sciences. The article outlines the philosophical atomism, which posits matter as made up of indivisible particles, and provides examples of ancient cultures' ideas on atoms.

Additionally, the text covers the evolution of atomic theory from its inception to modern perspectives, highlighting its role in advancing our understanding of atomic behavior and interactions.  Atomic theory is a fundamental aspect of modern science, contributing significantly to various branches like chemistry, physics, and biology. It began with the assumption that matter consists of indivisible particles, later expanded to include the recognition of specific types of atoms as building blocks of substances, and ultimately reevaluated the role of atoms within chemical elements. Atomic theory remains a cornerstone of modern understanding of the universe.  The article also touches on the historical development",

      "reference_summary": "The Barnum effect, also known as the Forer effect, is a psychological phenomenon where people rate vague, general personality descriptions as highly accurate for themselves, even though these descriptions could apply to many people. This effect helps explain the popularity of paranormal beliefs and practices like astrology and fortune telling. Originally termed the \"fallacy of personal validation\" by psychologist Bertram Forer, the effect was later named after showman P.T. Barnum by psychologist Paul Meehl. The Barnum effect occurs because people tend to accept general characterizations as true for them, a tendency known as the acceptance phenomenon. This effect is used by practitioners to convince customers of their paranormal abilities. Early research by Ross Stagner in 1947 highlighted this tendency among personnel managers.",

This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some paranormal beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, aura reading, and personality tests. It involves the Barnum effect being the fallacy of personal validation and related phenomena like subjective validation. The Barnum effect can explain why some paranormal beliefs and practices have been accepted despite the lack of empirical evidence supporting them. The Barnum effect has implications for how we understand the nature of mental illness and the reliability of medical diagnoses.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The Barnum effect is a psychological phenomenon where individuals give high accuracy ratings to vague and general personality descriptions, even when these descriptions are actually specific to them. This effect can explain the widespread acceptance of some paranormal beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, aura reading, and personality tests. Psychologist Bertram Forer initially named it the \"fallacy of personal validation,\" while psychologist Paul Meehl later coined the term \"Barnum effect\" in 1956 to explain this phenomenon. The effect is also related to the acceptance phenomenon, where humans tend to accept almost any bogus personality feedback. Early research involved personnel managers taking personality tests and subsequently rating their personalities.  The Barnum effect demonstrates how human behavior can be influenced by the perception of others' responses to specific stimuli.  It is worth noting that the exact mechanisms underlying this effect are still not fully understood.  Additionally, the Barnum effect can lead to increased suspicion of others' intentions or reliability among them.  However, it is important to note that not all vague personality descriptions are likely to lead to similar outcomes, as the effectiveness of the Barnum effect may vary depending on various factors.  Finally, the Barnum effect highlights the importance of careful data collection and analysis in research",

      "reference_summary": "An ice core is a cylindrical sample extracted from an ice sheet or glacier, representing layers of annual snow accumulation. These cores can reach depths over two miles and contain ice up to 800,000 years old. By analyzing the physical properties of the ice and trapped materials, scientists can reconstruct past climates, using isotopes to determine ancient temperatures and trapped air bubbles to measure historical atmospheric gas levels. Impurities vary by location, with coastal regions showing more marine influence and Greenland cores containing wind-blown dust. Ice cores have been studied since the early 20th century, with significant drilling projects during the International Geophysical Year and subsequent expeditions in Antarctica and Greenland. These cores provide valuable data for climate models and historical climate reconstructions. The structure of ice sheets includes layers of snow, firn (partially compacted snow), and finally dense ice. The transition from snow to ice occurs at a specific density threshold.

The ship's primary armament included two twin 13.5-inch guns and sixteen single 6-inch guns. Its size made it unsuitable for combat purposes, so it was later used as a training ship. The ship was eventually scrapped in 1922, and its parts were sold off the following year.  The ship's name \"Erin\" likely refers to its purpose as a training ship.  The ship was built at the Vickers works in Folkestone, Kent, and commissioned into the British Navy in 1913.

Most livestock are herbivores, except for pigs and chickens which are omnivores. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass, while pigs and poultry cannot digest cellulose.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The Black Hawk War was a conflict between the United States and Native Americans, led by Black Hawk. It began on April 6, 1832, when Black Hawk's British Band, along with Sauk, Menominee, and Dakota allies, entered Illinois from Iowa. Black Hawk's primary goal was to reclaim land that had been taken over by the United States due to the 1804 Treaty of St. Louis. Initially, U.S. officials believed Black Hawk and his band to be hostile, leading to a mobilization of the Militia to suppress their activities. On May 14, the U.S. army captured Black Hawk's band, which included some Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi warriors. However, Black Hawk's band was weakened by food scarcity, death, and desertion, and it eventually retreated towards the Mississippi River. On August 2, U.S. forces attacked the remaining British Band at Bad Axe, killing many and capturing most survivors. Abraham Lincoln did not serve in this war.

Although not extensively damaged, it remained under Royal protection until the early 16th century. The castle played an important role in the history of Britain and remains one of the largest castles in Wales and the second-largest in the UK.\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Caerphilly Castle is a medieval castle located in Caerphilly, South Wales, built by Gilbert de Clare in the 13th century to defend his kingdoms in Glamorgan. It covers approximately 30 acres and is the largest and second-largest castles in Wales and the UK after Windsor Castle. Known for its concentric castle design, it features large gatehouses. Construction started in 1268 with significant renovation in 1325-1326. During various conflicts, including the Welsh Wars in the 1320s and the English Civil War in the 14th century, the castle suffered damage or destruction. Today, it is a ruin but remains notable due to its architectural style and historical significance. The castle was later restored under Cadw's control. Gilbert's intention was to introduce concentric castle designs throughout Britain, which he likely influenced through his works at Kenilworth Castle.  The castle was also vulnerable during the Llywelyn and Llywelyn Bren revolts, while Edward II faced challenges during his reign. As such, maintaining its authenticity is important for understanding the evolution of medieval architecture.

Recognized by its black-and-white ringed tail, it is the sole member of the Lemur genus and is critically endangered. Found primarily in southern Madagascar's gallery forests and scrublands, it is omnivorous and more terrestrial than other lemurs. Highly social and female-dominated, ring-tailed lemurs live in groups of up to 30 individuals, engaging in mutual grooming and huddling for warmth. They are diurnal, known for sunbathing by sitting upright with their bellies exposed. The species heavily relies on scent marking for communication. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its endangered status. ",

It is one of the five lemur genera, and the only member of its species. Like all lemurs, it is endothermic and lives in groups of up to 30 individuals. These groups typically maintain warmth through communal huddling. Ring-tailed lemurs are strictly diurnal, active exclusively during daylight hours. Their social nature makes them highly adaptable, relying heavily on their sense of smell and territorial marking. As an omnivore, they consume a wide variety of food sources including fruit, leaves, and insects. Their unique social structure and habitat adaptations make the ring-tailed lemur a fascinating subject of study in zoology and ecology. The species has been extensively studied and is considered to be the most widely distributed lemur species globally. \n\n        The ring-tailed lemur is also known locally in [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] as ''{{lang|mg|maky}}'' ({{IPA|mg|makʲ||Mg-maky.ogg}}, spelled ''{{lang|fr|maki}}''), ''{{lang|mg",

Early's smaller army exploited the element of surprise and numerical advantages, capturing over 1,000 prisoners and 20 artillery pieces, forcing seven Union divisions to retreat. However, the Union Army, led by Philip Sheridan, rallied later in the day and launched a successful counterattack, recapturing their own artillery and seizing most of Early's artillery and wagons. Sheridan's arrival at the battlefield around 10:30 AM revitalized his retreating forces, and by 4:00 PM, Early's army was routed. The battle effectively ended the Confederate threat in the Shenandoah Valley, as Early's forces were never able to regain their strength or maneuver effectively again.",
      "base_model_summary": "The Battle of Cedar Creek was a decisive victory for the Union Army, which forced the Confederate forces to retreat and ultimately won the battle.\n        It is important to note that this was not just any battle; it was one of the most significant events in the history of the American Civil War. The Union Army was able to capture a large number of weapons and captured several divisions, including the **[file:CVcorpsbadge.png]*** unit. This battle demonstrated the Union Army's ability to hold its ground against the combined forces of both armies, leading to the eventual victory of the Union Army.\n        Furthermore, the battle marked the end of the Confederacy's role as a major power in the region, as they were unable to move further north into Virginia and could no longer engage in open warfare with the Union Army. The battle also had a lasting impact on the political landscape of the United States, as it paved the way for future conflicts between the two countries. Ultimately, the defeat of the Confederates at Cedar Creek was a pivotal moment in the American Civil War, demonstrating the power of unified action and the importance of fortifying the nation's borders. As a result, the Union Army continued to expand its influence throughout the country after the battle, establishing new forts and fort",
      "finetuned_model_summary": "The Battle of Cedar Creek or Battle of Belle Grove was fought on October 19, 1864 during the American Civil War. It involved Union and Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley, specifically near Cedar Creek. Early's Confederates emerged victorious, capturing over 1,000 prisoners and artillery pieces while forcing seven divisions to withdraw. On the Union side, Philip Sheridan's forces managed to capture most of Early's artillery and wagons. The battle was marked by heavy fog and early morning attacks by Early's army, which were later counterattacked by Sheridan's forces. This victory significantly weakened Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley and made it harder for them to maneuver further north to threaten Virginia. As a result, the Confederate army could not consolidate their gains and were eventually defeated at Gettysburg in November 1864.  The resulting damage to Confederate forces left them vulnerable to Union advances into southern Virginia.  The battle also demonstrated the effectiveness of Sheridan's withdrawal strategy, allowing him to regroup and focus his forces more effectively after the initial surge.  Despite this, Sheridan's success did not prevent him from facing further setbacks in the future, particularly in the face of Union pressure.  The Battle of Cedar Creek remains",

They come in various forms, such as introducing new genes or modifying existing ones, transferring genes between species, or deleting endogenous genes. The definition can vary based on the organism, but typically includes any organism where the gene did not appear naturally through mating or recombination. These organisms are developed through complex genetic engineering processes, often involving genome editing technologies like CRISPR. Herber Boyer and Stanley Cohen were among the first scientists to successfully engineer a genetically modified organism, and since then, numerous other groundbreaking studies have been conducted. Bacteria, fungi, and viruses are commonly used as models in genetic engineering due to their ease of manipulation. While there are concerns about the impact on the environment and human health, many researchers believe that GMOs hold significant promise for agriculture and medical applications.

Born in Miletus, she moved to Athens and became the partner of the statesman Pericles, with whom she had a son named Pericles the Younger. Traditionally, she was believed to have worked as a courtesan and faced charges of impiety, but modern scholars question these claims due to their origins in ancient comedy. Aspasia is one of the best-documented women from the Greco-Roman era, yet much of her life remains uncertain. She was depicted in various roles across ancient literature—ranging from a prostitute in Old Comedy to a teacher and rhetorician in philosophical works—and has continued to inspire artistic portrayals. The primary ancient source for her life is Plutarch’s “Life of Pericles,” written nearly seven centuries after her death. Due to the unreliable nature of these sources, little can be definitively established about her life beyond her name, father’s name, and place of birth. Aspasia's legacy lies in her influence and enduring fascination in both ancient and modern times.",

She died at the age of 63. Some sources say she was a madam, others say she was a prostitute, and some say she was a courtesan.\nIn ancient Greek culture, prostitutes were seen as dangerous and immoral beings, so many laws and regulations existed to restrict them. Aspasia would likely have been punished severely if she were found out. In ancient Greece, prostitution was considered to be a form of gambling. It was also believed that people who engaged in prostitution could not be trusted with wealth, so the state would confiscate their property if they were caught.\nIn ancient Rome, prostitution was also illegal, and as such was treated much like slavery. Women who engaged in prostitution faced severe punishments, including torture and execution. This was because prostitution was often used as a means of punishment, particularly in times of war or civil unrest. Many Roman emperors, including Julius Caesar, Nero, and Claudius, were known to have been involved in the brothels and prostitution rings in Rome. They were paid high wages and enjoyed",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "'Branded to Kill' is a 1967 Japanese yakuza film directed by Seijun Suzuki. It stars Joe Shishido, Koji Nanbara, Annu Mari, and Mariko Ogawa. The story follows contract killer Goro Hanada as he is recruited by Misako for a seemingly impossible mission. When the mission fails, he is hunted by the phantom Number One Killer, who threatens his life and sanity. The film was designated as a low-budget B movie by its production company and distributor, Nikkatsu, but was later adapted into a satirical and anarchic novel. The screenplay was written by Hachiro Guryu and the writing collective of Takeo Kimura and Atsushi Yamatoya. Post-production was completed only a day before the scheduled release, leading to criticism from Nikkatsu. Suzuki was blacklisted for a decade after this film, but became a cultural icon. \"Branded to Kill\" has since gained a strong international cult following and is often cited as an influence by filmmakers and critics. In the 1980s, it was considered an absurdist masterpiece.  This summary captures the key points and arguments of the article, providing a comprehensive overview of the film's plot",

As First Lady, she became reclusive and distant from her husband, focusing instead on writing. After her husband's loss of re-election, she supported abolitionism and women's rights. She died in 1852 at age 77, and Congress adjourned for her funeral, a first for a woman. Louisa Adams is the only foreign-born first lady until Melania Trump and is generally rated highly by historians.",

Born in England, she moved to Philadelphia when he was young and later married into an American family. Their marriage was marked by personality conflicts, with John Quincy eventually resigning from the US Senate to live in Russia. During their marriage, she served in the Russian Imperial forces under General Washburne, where she became involved in political activities. In 1809, she was chosen to be a secretary to the Russian Emperor, but this did not last long as John Quincy Adams decided to remain in the US. As their marriage continued, she became involved in building relationships for his presidential campaign. She also took up writing, producing plays, essays, poems, and an autobiography. However, her retirement after his election to the US House of Representatives was difficult, and she died at the age of 77. Her widow remarried in 1848 but did not have any children. Although her term is less studied than those of previous first ladies, it is generally considered high praise.   1775-1788: Louisa Catherine Johnson was born in London, England.",

It features vehicle construction gameplay and a customisable environment. Released as a remaster of the original game, it was criticized for leaving Banjo and Kazooie too far away from their intended role as explorers. However, it has since become a cult classic due to its creative approach and emphasis on player autonomy. Its focus on building vehicles rather than exploration also distinguishes it from other similar titles. The game has enjoyed mixed critical reception, though it has remained influential in the world of virtual reality gaming. - References: Rare, Gregg Mayles, Robin Beanland, David Clynick, Grant Kirkhope, Timothy Stamper, Gregg Mayles, Tim Stamper, Tim Stamper, Gregg Mayles, Gregg Mayles, Robin Beanland, David Clynick, Robin Beanland, Grant Kirkhope, Timothy Stamper, Gregg Mayles, Gregg Mayles, Tim Stamper, Gregg Mayles, Gregg Mayles, Timothy Stamper, Gregg Mayles, Gregg Mayles, Gregg Mayles, Gregg Mayles, Gregg Mayles, Gregg Mayles, Gregg Mayles, Gregg Mayles,",

Eight years after the successful \"Banjo-Kazooie,\" this game focuses on vehicle construction rather than exploring environments. Players design and build cars, boats, and aircraft to navigate through levels, competing against Gruntilda. It allows for multiple player interactions through multiplayer features like Xbox Live. Initially a remake of \"Banjo-Kazooie,\" it later gained popularity due to its innovative vehicle creation system and artistic direction. Despite initial skepticism, the game was later used as a basis for more advanced titles. Its reception varied, with critics praising its graphics and sound but finding some aspects too challenging. By the end of 2008, it sold 14 million copies worldwide. This game significantly boosted Rare's stock and contributed to their reorganization into a Kinect and Avatar-focused development.

      "reference_summary": "Millipedes, scientifically known as Diplopoda, are arthropods characterized by having two pairs of legs per body segment. They have elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies and belong to one of 16 orders and around 140 families, with about 12,000 named species. Despite their name, which means \"thousand feet,\" no millipede species was known to have over 1,000 legs until the discovery of Eumillipes persephone in 2020, which can have over 1,300 legs. Millipedes are primarily detritivores, feeding on decaying plant matter, though some consume fungi or drink plant fluids. They defend themselves using chemical secretions and by curling into a tight coil. Reproduction involves the use of specialized male legs called gonopods to transfer sperm to females. Millipedes first appeared in the Silurian period and are among the oldest known land animals, with some prehistoric species reaching up to 2 meters in length. The largest current species, the giant African millipede, measures up to 38 cm. Their study is known as diplopodology. Millipedes are often confused with centipedes, which differ by moving faster, being venomous, carnivorous, and having only one pair of legs per segment. The scientific name \"Diplopoda\" comes from the fusion of two single segments to form each double-legged segment. Some molecular studies suggest that pauropods may not be the closest relatives to millipedes despite traditional beliefs. Millipedes can be pests in greenhouses, damaging emerging seedlings. They curl into a tight coil when threatened to protect their vulnerable parts. The term \"millipede\" is widely used, but some North American scientists prefer \"milliped.\" ",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Hydrogen is the lightest element and serves as a gas at standard conditions. Its chemical symbol is H and atomic number is 1. It is colorless, odorless, non-toxic, and highly combustible. Hydrogen constitutes about 75% of all normal matter in the universe and is the most abundant chemical element there. Stars, including the Sun, primarily consist of hydrogen in a plasma state, while on Earth, it exists as water, organic compounds, and other molecular forms. The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium (1H). In the early universe, hydrogen's protons formed approximately 370,000 years after the Big Bang, while neutral hydrogen atoms joined about 3 million years after that time. Hydrogen gas was first produced artificially in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids with metals. Henry Cavendish identified hydrogen gas as a distinct substance in 1766-81 and recognized its ability to produce water when burned, thus naming it \"water-former.\" Understanding the absorption of light by hydrogen's various states allows us to observe its colorful properties. Summary: Hydrogen is the lightest element and serves as a gas at standard conditions. Its chemical symbol is H",

It was also the largest recorded tropical cyclone, spanning 2,220 km (1,380 mi). After landfall in southern Japan on October 19, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated near the Aleutian Islands on October 24. Tip caused widespread damage and flooding across several countries, including the Caroline Islands, Philippines, Korea, Japan, Northeast China, Russian Far East, and Alaska. The typhoon resulted in 99 deaths and $483 million in damages. Additionally, rainfall from Tip contributed to a fire at Combined Arms Training Center, Camp Fuji, in Japan, which killed 13 United States Marines and injured 68 others. Extensive observations by U.S. Air Force aircraft made Tip one of the most closely studied tropical cyclones.",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The Centurion-class pre-dreadnought battleships were a pair of British pre-dreadnought battleships built during the 1890s for the Royal Navy. They were classified as second-class due to their lower armament and armours compared to first-class ships. Constructed in 1894, HMS Centurion and HMS Barfleur were both part of the China Station or Mediterranean Fleet, typically serving as the flagship of the former. Their sister ships were later used in the Boxer Rebellion suppression in 1900, while HMS Barfleur was designated as a cruiser and served as the flagship of the Portsmouth Division of the Reserve Fleet from 1905 to 1909, eventually being decommissioned and scrapped in 1909. Both ships were eventually scrapped.  The classes were also subject to further modifications over time, including increased speed and deeper draught requirements.  Overall, the Centurion-class represented a compromise between fast combat capabilities and heavy armament found in more modern battleships.

      "reference_summary": "The main sequence is a classification of stars appearing as a continuous band on color-brightness plots called Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams. Main-sequence stars, including the Sun, are characterized by nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in their cores, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. The position of a star on the main sequence depends on its mass, chemical composition, and age. Stars below 1.5 solar masses use the proton-proton chain to generate energy, while those above use the CNO cycle. Heavier stars have shorter lifespans on the main sequence. Once the hydrogen fuel in the core is depleted, stars evolve into giants or supergiants before becoming white dwarfs. The concept was developed in the early 20th century with advancements in stellar spectroscopy. Summary: The main sequence classifies stars as a continuous band on Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, plotting color versus brightness. Main-sequence stars, like the Sun, fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores, sustaining hydrostatic equilibrium. A star's position on the main sequence is determined by its mass, chemical composition, and age. Stars below 1.5 solar masses use the proton-proton chain for energy production, while heavier ones use the CNO cycle. More massive stars have shorter lifespans. After depleting core hydrogen, they evolve into giants or supergiants before becoming white dwarfs. This concept emerged in the early 20th century with advances in stellar spectroscopy.",
      "base_model_summary": "The main sequence is a classification of star light patterns on plots of stellar colors versus brightness, indicating the order of star formation and progression through several star-life cycles. It is named after Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell, who discovered many of these stars. Starlight patterns can be represented as a horizontal line across a figure drawn diagonally between the two main sequences, showing how luminous stars are classified based on their brightness and their distance from Earth. Main-sequence stars consist of those that produce enough energy to heat their atmospheres to temperatures sufficient for fusion to occur in their cores and that continue to evolve until they become red giants, white dwarfs, or supernovae. Their light patterns show a clear, consistent pattern that can be used to determine the type of star. In astronomy, the main sequence classification is used to identify a star's type, and to predict its future behavior.

Stars on this band are known as main-sequence stars or dwarf stars and indicate their physical properties and progression through several types of star life-cycles. The main sequence is the most numerous true stars in the universe and includes the Sun. It is divided into upper and lower parts based on the process a star uses to generate energy, with the Sun primarily fusing hydrogen in the protons–protons chain and other stars burning hydrogen through the CNO cycle. As stars evolve, they move away from the main sequence into a supergiant, red giant, or white dwarf. Early in their lives, stars on the main sequence are relatively short-lived. The history of star classification began with Annie Jump Cannon and Edward Charles Pickering at the Harvard College Observatory in the early 19th century.

Iraq invaded from Kuwait, targeting coalition forces along the coastline. Coalition forces engaged Iraqi forces, with US-led coalition victory over Iraqi forces. Key figures included Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ordering an invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi rocket attacks on Israel, and coalition commanders conducting a multi-pronged invasion toward Khafji.\n        In summary, it is clear that this event marked the beginning of the Gulf War and played a crucial role in the outcome of the conflict between the United States and Iraq. The coalition's success led to the unconditional surrender of Iraqi forces. Despite its significance, the Battle of Khafji has been largely forgotten, as it was overshadowed by other events in the war such as the [infobox]Operation Desert Storm[infobox]. Additionally, it is worth noting that there are no records or official statements about coalition forces engaging Iraqi forces before this event, which may have contributed to their perceived insignificance in the broader context of the conflict.

Iraqis, led by Saddam Hussein, launched an invasion of Saudi Arabia from Kuwait, aiming to secure the country for their war aims. This involved a multinational coalition including Saudi Arabia, the United States, and others. The coalition emerged victorious, with Coalition estimates for losses ranging from 43 killed to 52 wounded, while Iraqi forces suffered 71 killed and 148 wounded, with over 90 armored vehicles destroyed. The war significantly boosted US and UK diplomatic pressure on Iraq, contributing to its eventual collapse.  The battle demonstrated the effectiveness of a coalition response to a major military operation.  The name \"Khafji\" likely derives from the nearby town of Khafaa, which is considered a holy site for Islam.  The article also touches on other significant events and outcomes of the war, such as the destruction of Scud missiles fired at Israel and the capture of Sabah by the coalition forces.

His reign saw victories against the Gepids, facilitated by an alliance with the Avars, which ultimately prompted Alboin to move his people into Italy, exploiting the weakened Byzantine presence post-Gothic War. Alboin quickly seized much of northern Italy, including Milan, though Pavia resisted for three years. His rule was marred by internal dissent, leading to his assassination in 572 by his foster brother Helmichis and his wife Rosamund, a Gepid princess.

It's often used for counting and measuring, and its value reflects combining elements from two sets. Addition is commutative and associative, meaning the order doesn't affect the outcome. Another important property is the presence of zero as an additive identity, allowing any quantity to be added to it. Addition is fundamental in many areas of mathematics, including algebra, and it forms the basis for more complex operations like subtraction and multiplication. Computerized systems rely heavily on performing addition efficiently, especially in scenarios involving large datasets or rapid calculations. The term \"addition\" comes from the Latin word \"addere,\" meaning \"to put together.\" The concept extends beyond simple numerical computation, becoming part of advanced topics in discrete mathematics and philosophy. In various cultures, people have developed different names and notations for adding, reflecting their unique understanding and historical development. Here are some examples:\n\n- In some cultures, it's referred to as \"mumma math\"\n- In some languages, it's known as \"duets\"\n- In others, it's called \"suma\"\n- In some regions, it's colloquially known as \"addition\"\n\nIn summary, addition is",

It has been active since the Early Pleistocene or Late Pliocene epoch, with three major eruptive periods over the past two million years. The current volcanic activity started around 150,000 years ago, and it produces pyroclastic flows that can cause significant harm, particularly during lahars. The most recent devastating eruption was in 1985, resulting in the death of approximately 25,000 people. Additionally, the area around the volcano is covered by large ice caps, contributing to its continued threat to the nearby communities. 1936 saw the ascent of Cunet and Augusto Gansser-Biaggi, who are credited with discovering this feature.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The passenger pigeon, also known as the wild pigeon, was an extinct species of pigeon that was endemic to North America. It had migratory habits and was much larger and more colorful than modern pigeons. The passenger pigeon was sexually dimorphic, with males being gray and females being brownish-gray. They lived in deciduous forests and were known for their great flight capabilities, reaching speeds of over 100 kilometers per hour. Despite this, their numbers were so high that they filled entire continents, with estimates suggesting around 3 billion and possibly up to 5 billion individuals. The passenger pigeon was preyed upon primarily on mast, fruits, and invertebrates. Although they were not killed outright, their predation led to significant population declines. Additionally, their extensive communal roosting and breeding practices made them vulnerable to human exploitation. With no natural predators, the passenger pigeon became vulnerable to over-harvesting and habitat destruction due to deforestation. As a result, their number significantly decreased and eventually came to an end due to these factors.  The passenger pigeon was listed as extinct under the IUCN's Extinction Program as of 1914.  It was later reclassified as \"Ex\" (extinct) based on genetic evidence",

This species has been extinct for thousands of years and is now considered vulnerable due to habitat loss and overfishing. It can grow up to several meters long and weigh hundreds of tons. Its scientific name means \"physically rich\" in Latin, referring to its thick baleen plates that help filter marine life from the water. Despite being relatively small compared to other whales, it plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of the marine ecosystem by filtering plankton and fish from the ocean. However, overfishing and environmental pressures have led to its decline, making it an endangered species.\n\n        Short description: The Fin Whale (Balaenoptera physalus) is a large baleen whale species native to the North Sea and Baltic Sea, which have been extant for thousands of years.\n        Large baleen whale species\n        Fossil range\n        Name\n        Image\n        Status\n        Status system\n        Genus\n        Species\n        Authority\n        Range map\n        Range map caption",

These wars occurred during the broader War of the Austrian Succession (First and Second Silesian Wars) and the Seven Years' War (Third Silesian War). Prussia, led by King Frederick II, won all three wars, ultimately securing most of Silesia. These victories elevated Prussia to a great European power, particularly among Protestant German states, while diminishing Austria’s prestige. The wars set the stage for future Austro-Prussian rivalries for German leadership, culminating in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. The underlying reasons for the conflicts included dynastic claims, realpolitik, and geostrategic interests, as well as Prussia's desire to exploit the Habsburg succession crisis to gain an advantage over regional competitors like Saxony and Bavaria. The wars reshaped the balance of power in Central Europe. Summary:",
      "base_model_summary": "The 18th-century war between Prussia and Austria, known as the Silesian Wars, took place in central Europe from 1740 to 1763. It began when Prussia claimed ownership of Silesia, a region that had been occupied by the Habsburg monarchy since the First Silesian War. The conflict lasted for three years, resulting in Prussia's victory and the acquisition of most of the Silesian territories. The wars had significant geopolitical implications for the regions they affected, including the expansion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the weakening of the House of Habsburg.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The Silesian Wars were three wars fought from 1740 to 1763 between Prussia and Austria, aimed at gaining control of Silesia, now part of modern Poland. These conflicts were part of the Austro-Prussian rivalry and involved significant regional powers like the Habsburg Monarchy, the Electorate of Saxony, the Russian Empire, and the French Republic. The war was rooted in Prussian aspirations for more territory and their response to Maria Theresa's potential claim to the Habsburg throne. Additionally, the geographical spread of the wars, covering most of central Europe, made them a strategic move by Prussia to assert dominance over the German-speaking world. The outcome of these conflicts left Prussia as a powerful nation with influence over much of Central Europe, while Austria faced challenges in maintaining its hold on some areas. This period is often considered a prelude to the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.  The wars did not start with specific historical events, but rather were driven by geostrategic and Realpolitik considerations. The First Silesian War followed a precedent set by the Second, resulting in Prussias' acquisition of most of Silesia. The third war, however,",

It varies in gauge, range, mobility, rate of fire, elevation, and firepower, designed specifically for each purpose. The term \"cannon\" initially referred to tubes, cans, or reeds, later evolving into guns or artillery, and finally to autocannons. The earliest known depiction dates back to the Song dynasty, while the first extant cannon was produced in the 13th century. As trade and technology progressed, cannons were used primarily as infantry defense weapons from 1374 to 1453, then expanded to siege weapons and eventually to field artillery. Their evolution over time includes heavier and more accurate cannons reaching their classic form around 1480.

He is often referred to as the \"discoverer of Brazil,\" making his first voyage across four continents from Europe to reach the Northeastern coast of South America. Born in Belmonte, he received a good education and joined Vasco da Gama's newly established fleet to undertake their journey to India. On their return voyage, Cabral used the land he discovered as justification for claiming it for Portugal, which later became Brazil. His fleet set out from Lisbon on April 1500, encountering some difficulty due to stormy weather in the southern Atlantic Ocean. Cabral successfully navigated through this period and eventually reached the Northeastern coast of South America, where he reported discovering the continent to Manuel I of Portugal. During his time in the New World, he established trade relationships with indigenous peoples. Cabral died at Santarém in 1520 while exploring the coastline near the town.

The design was based on the \"Delta Dagger\" prototype, a supersonic interceptor aircraft, modified for use in carrier operations.

The aircraft was intended to serve as a light air-to-ground weapon, but did not enter mass production due to safety concerns.

It used twin hydro-skis for takeoff and landing, and was designed to float with the trailing edge of the wings touching the water during takeoff. The Sea Dart could not fly as fast as supersonic aircraft, so it was not included in the Navy's supersonic interceptor aircraft program.

The RNAi pathway involves the cleavage of dsRNA into short double-stranded fragments by a specific enzyme called Dicer, followed by the binding and degradation of the resulting siRNAs by Argonaute proteins. These complexes assemble into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and degrade the target mRNA, leading to gene silencing. While the use of synthetic dsRNA to induce RNAi is promising, caution must be exercised due to the potential for unintended effects and the need for thorough testing before widespread use.

Historically, it was referred to as co-suppression, post-transcriptional gene silencing, or quelling. Andrew Fire and Craig Mello share the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006 for their work on RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans. RNAi is highly effective at suppressing unwanted genes, making it a promising treatment option. Two types of small RNA, microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA), are essential components of the RNAi pathway. MiRNA and siRNA block protein translation by recruiting Argonaute 2, leading to its degradation. During this process, the siRNA serves as a precursor for another siRNA, allowing for continued RNAi. RNAi is naturally occurring in eukaryotes and animals, initiated by the enzyme Dicer, which breaks up dsRNA into siRNAs. These siRNAs are then processed by Ago2 to form a duplex structure, which triggers the degradation of the targeted mRNA. The process can be used for large-scale screening of potential drug targets.

Only approximately 1 million units were sold, leading to its commercial failure. The Sega Mega Jet was used as a precursor, although the Nomad lacks this feature. The Nomad's remote control operation required a touchpad and did not support any built-in features like text messaging or movie playback. Its development started after the Game Gear's touchscreens became too expensive.  The Genesis Nomad was released in October 1995 for North America, followed by its international release in 1999. It used three.25-inch backlit color screens and had a 6 AA battery life. The Nomad was based on the Sega Genesis, requiring the Motorola 68000 processor and 4 hours of runtime.

As the first Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of Abkhazia from 1922 to 1936, he secured Abkhazia's initial autonomy within the USSR, leveraging his close relationship with Joseph Stalin. Despite opposition from Stalin's confidant Lavrentiy Beria, Lakoba managed to prevent full collectivization in Abkhazia but had to settle for autonomous republic status within the Georgian SSR. Lakoba died under suspicious circumstances in 1936, likely poisoned during a visit to Tbilisi. Rehabilitated post-Stalin, he is now regarded as a national hero in Abkhazia. His influence and close ties with Stalin were crucial in shaping Abkhazia's political trajectory in the early Soviet period.",

He became the first Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia, serving from 1922 to 1936. Lakoba held this position despite facing opposition from Joseph Stalin, who often visited Abkhazia in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Despite being close to Stalin, Lakoba was ultimately replaced by another member of the Red Army, Avksenty Rapava. His rivalry with Stalin was rooted in the friendship he had with Beria, who was involved in the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (TSFSR), which included Georgia. During a visit to Beria in Tbilisi in December 1936, Lakoba was poisoned and survived the event,",
      "finetuned_model_summary": "Nestor Lakoba was an Abkhaz Communist leader who played a crucial role in establishing Bolshevik power in Abkhazia after World War I. He served as the head of Abkhazia from 1922 to 1936, initially under the name \"Socialist Soviet Republic of Abkhazia.\" Despite this title, he remained an autonomous republic within the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1921, he led a group known as the Red Army into Abkhazia, where he later became involved in collectingivizing the region. However, he also worked closely with Joseph Stalin, maintaining a personal connection despite their sometimes hostile relations. During his time in power, he successfully promoted local self-government and resistance against foreign influence, although this led to his assassination in 1953, which has since restored him to national hero status in Abkhazia. His influence can still be felt in the modern state of Georgia. Key events in his life include his early education in Abkhazia, his marriage to Sariya Lakoba, and his notable son, Rafu. He lived from 1893 until his death in Tbilisi in 1936.  Summary:",

      "base_model_summary": "The Great Stink was an event in central London during July and August 1858 in which the hot weather exacerbated the smell of untreated human waste and industrial effluent that was present on the banks of the River Thames. The problem had been growing for several years and three outbreaks of cholera before the Great Stink were blamed on the ongoing problems with the river. Joseph Bazalgette proposed moving the effluent eastwards along a series of interconnected sewers that sloped towards outfalls beyond the metropolitan area. This led to the construction of pumping stations to lift sewage from lower levels into higher pipes, which also raised concerns about the safety of the sewage discharge. Bazalgette's work helped to ensure that sewage was no longer dumped onto the shores of the Thames and brought an end to the cholera outbreaks. His plans were later implemented and the river remains open to today. Bazalgette's contribution to the sanitation of London is considered heroic. The Great Stink is still visible today and serves as a reminder of the importance of proper sanitation in urban areas. It highlights the challenges faced in managing the spread of infectious diseases and the need for continued improvements in sewage treatment systems.

      "reference_summary": "A castle is a fortified structure built during the Middle Ages by nobility or royalty in Europe, serving as a private residence and fortress. Unlike mansions, palaces, and villas, which were mainly for pleasure, castles had defensive purposes. Castles varied widely in form but commonly featured curtain walls, arrow slits, and portcullises. Originating in the 9th and 10th centuries following the collapse of the Carolingian Empire, castles were constructed by individual lords to exert control over their territories. They functioned as military bases for launching raids, administrative centers, and symbols of power. Often initially built from earth and timber, many were later fortified with stone. Castles were strategically located near resources essential to the community, such as mills, fertile land, and water sources. Their construction aimed to control local populations and important travel routes. Examples include the Alcázar of Segovia in Spain and Bodiam Castle in England. Over time, the term \"castle\" has been applied more broadly, including hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes resembling castles. Post-medieval \"pleasances\" were built to mimic castles, serving as \"landscape propaganda\" to affirm noble status. ",
      "base_model_summary": "A medieval castle is a fortified structure consisting of a defensive tower surrounded by walls and ramparts. It can be a private residence or an official fortress. The earliest castles date back to the 12th century and have served various purposes throughout history, including as palaces, forts, and residences for royalty and nobility. Castles are notable for their impressive architecture, often featuring colorful facades and intricate designs. They have played significant roles in history, serving as bastions against invaders, centers of government, and symbols of power. Many castles have been rebuilt and modified over centuries, maintaining their original architectural styles while incorporating new elements. While traditional castle construction methods still exist today, newer technologies like stone masonry and prefabricated materials have revolutionized castle design, making them more durable and easier to construct.\n    - The summary must include at least two supporting paragraphs. -\n    - The first paragraph should contain information about the origin and development of castles in medieval Europe. -\n    - The second paragraph should explain the significance of castles in history and their current usage. -\n    - Both paragraphs should focus on providing clear and concise information, avoiding unnecessary details. -\n    - The summary should adhere to proper formatting guidelines. - The summary:\n\nA **castle**",
      "finetuned_model_summary": "A castle is a fortified structure built during the Middle Ages, primarily by the nobility or royalty and military orders. It is a private residence of a lord or nobleman, distinct from mansions, palaces, or villas designed exclusively for pleasure. Castles can take various forms, including garrisons, palace complexes, or simply constructed enclosures. Their primary purpose was defense, with walls and towers to protect against attack. Over time, while some castles have evolved into more modern homes, others remain significant architectural gems. European-style castles emerged after the Carolingian Empire's division, focusing on controlling areas around cities and providing security from enemies. Northern European castles were typically built from earth and timber with stone later added for defense. Stone castles were favored in coastal areas, while wooden ones were common in mountainous regions. Modern interpretations often include elements of stonemasonry.

Known primarily among young, working-class men affected by the Great Depression, the NWOBHM established underground communities separate from mainstream society, which helped to popularize the genre. It produced over a hundred heavy metal bands, most surviving into the 1980s, while others later merged into extreme metal subgenres. Some prominent members of the NWOBHM include Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Motörhead, and Saxon. Reunions among former bands occurred in the 2000s, maintaining their connection to live performances and studio albums. Social unrest during this period included the British miners' strike of 1984.

This pterosaur was the first from North Africa and the second from Morocco, and it belongs to the subfamily Pterosaurinae. With a well-documented cervical vertebra, its neck length is estimated at around 865 mm, indicating it was quite long. The vertebrae show evidence of segmentation into three parts: C5-C7, which makes up most of its neck, and C8, which is particularly elongated. Phosphatodraco's position among extinct pterosaurs is uncertain, but it seems likely to have been a掠食性pterosaur catching fish from the sea. Its close relatives include Aralazhdarcho and Eurazhdarcho, although the extinction of pterosaurs was rapid.

The galaxy has an isophotal diameter of about 46.56 kpc and is estimated to have a mass of around 1 x 10^12 solar masses. Despite its small size, the Andromeda Galaxy is believed to contain trillions of stars, with a blue mag of -21.5. It is part of the Large Magellanic Cloud, also known as M31, and is classified under the designation NGC 224. The galaxy has a low density due to its large size, making it easier to observe from Earth. As of now, its exact mass remains uncertain, although studies suggest it may be closer to the Milky Way's mass.  {{preserve style=\"\"}} {{data-type=text|en|3}} {{/data-type} }  {{/infobox}} {{/article}}  Summary: The Andromeda Galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy located approximately",

The family is divided into three subfamilies: Caninae (which includes domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, foxes, jackals, and other related species), and the extinct Borophaginae and Hesperocyoninae. Canids are found on every continent except Antarctica and vary significantly in size, from the large gray wolf to the small fennec fox. They share similar physical characteristics such as long muzzles, upright ears, and bushy tails, and are typically social animals living in family units. Communication among canids involves scent signals and vocalizations. The domestic dog, originating from a symbiotic relationship with humans, is the most widely kept domestic animal.
