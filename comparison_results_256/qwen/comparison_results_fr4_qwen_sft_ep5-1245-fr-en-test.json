The size of the top and bottom can vary. The modern bikini was introduced by Louis Réard in 1946 and became popular due to its revealing design, which was initially controversial. It was banned in several countries and criticized by some feminist groups. The bikini became increasingly popular as film stars like Brigitte Bardot, Raquel Welch, and Ursula Andress wore it, and was commonly used in beach volleyball and bodybuilding. There are various styles of bikinis, such as monokini and tankini, among others. A man's single piece swimsuit is called a bikini brief, while women's and men's underwear types are described as bikini underwear.

It is often accidentally caught in commercial and recreational fisheries and may be used for shark meal and liver oil. The species has declined significantly in the northeastern Atlantic due to overfishing, so conservation efforts are essential. The original description of the bramble shark dates back to 1788 by Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre, who named it \"Squalus brucus\" and described it as a new species. The genus \"Echinorhinus\" was created by Henri de Blainville in 1816. The shark is sometimes confused with the prickly shark (E. cookei), but they have different",

The last naked-eye supernova observed in our galaxy was Kepler's Supernova in 1604; the most recent one visible without a telescope was SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Supernovae are primarily caused by two mechanisms: re-ignition of nuclear fusion in white dwarfs or gravitational collapse of massive stars' cores. These events expel vast amounts of material into space, enriching the interstellar medium with elements crucial for star formation and contributing to cosmic rays and possibly gravitational waves. The term \"supernova\" was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s to distinguish these phenomena from less luminous novae.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "A supernova is a powerful and luminous explosion in the last evolutionary stages of a massive or white dwarf. The progenitor either collapses to a neutron star, a black hole, or is completely destroyed to form a diffuse nebula. The peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months. Most supernovae are triggered by the re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a white dwarf or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. Supernovae expel several solar masses of material at speeds up to several percent of the speed of light, drive an expanding shock wave into the interstellar medium, and trigger star formation if they contain oxygen to rubidium. They also produce cosmic rays and possibly gravitational waves. The term \"supernova\" comes from the Latin word for \"new,\" differentiated from \"ordinary novae.\" The word was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1931.

Notable examples include carnivorous Herrerasaurus, herbivorous Triceratops and Stegosaurus, sauropod Apatosaurus, and the bird-like dromaeosaurid Microraptor. Additionally, there are several other possible dinosaur species of uncertain affinity, such as Alwalkeria, Chilesaurus, Daemonosaurus, and Tawa. Modern birds are considered part of the theropod lineage, marking the continuation of dinosaur presence into the current era. The classification of some groups, like Silesauridae, remains debated due to potential paraphyly. Dinosaurs have been studied extensively, with significant contributions from researchers such as Matthew G. Baron, Megan E. Williams, and Andrea Cau.",

This property is useful in many areas, including arithmetic and algebra. For example, the binary operation of addition is commutative, meaning that x + y = y + x for all x, y in the set S. Division and subtraction are noncommutative, while exponentiation is anti-commutative. Mathematical proofs often rely on the concept of commutativity, and the term \"commutative\" comes from the Latin word for \"to turn around\". One example of a commutative operation is multiplication, where x * y = y * x for all x, y in the set S. Noncommutative operations, such as division and subtraction, can be more complex and are harder to prove than commutative operations. The property also applies to binary relations, where a binary relation R on a set S is said to be symmetric if R(x, y) = R(y, x) for all x, y in S. A binary relation is said to be symmetric if it is commutative, meaning that if xRy, then yRx. A binary relation is also said to be transitive if for",

It is considered one of the best edible mushrooms in its genus, often described as having a mild, nutty, fruity, or sweet flavor. Native to Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America, this species is found in deciduous and mixed forests, forming mycorrhizal relationships with broadleaf trees like oak and European beech. It is noted for its unique ribonuclease enzyme, biologically active polysaccharides, and laccase enzyme, which can break down dyes. Initially described by Jacob Christian Schaeffer in 1774, the species was later classified under the genus \"Russula\" by Elias Magnus Fries in 1836. Despite its popularity, its presence in North America remains unclear due to confusion with similar species. The mushroom is rich in carbohydrates and proteins, with a low fat content.",

The white-winged fairywren primarily feeds on insects, supplemented by small fruits and leaf buds. They occur in heathlands and scrubland, where low shrubs provide cover. Like other fairywrens, they are cooperative breeders, maintaining and defending territories throughout the year. Females and juveniles tend to be similar in size and plumage, while males exhibit distinct sexual dimorphism and larger males grow brighter-colored plumage during the breeding season. The white-winged fairywren is also known for engaging in courtship displays, where the male picks petals from flowers and displays them to female birds. This behavior suggests promiscuity and helps raise offspring from other pairings.

Phagocytes work by recognizing and engulfing pathogen particles and participating in the repair and removal of damaged tissue. During infections, phagocytes are attracted to invaded areas by chemical signals, coming from both pathogens and neighboring cells. The process involves the activation of receptor molecules on the surface of the phagocyte, allowing it to recognize and engulf the pathogen or other invading particles.

She was used primarily for patrol duties in the North Sea, participating in major battles such as the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917. Despite her limited armament and lack of heavy weaponry, she played a significant role in supporting the Royal Navy's efforts against Germany during the war years. '''Courageous''''s importance and significance were further emphasized by her being sunk by US submarine U-29 on 17 September 1939, which ended her service and history as a combat vessel. '''Courageous''''s construction date is given as 1915, while the ship's decommissioning occurred in 1924, reflecting the long-term operational status of this early-era British ship.

The revolt, part of the larger Glorious Revolution, led to the dissolution of the Dominion and the reinstatement of previous colonial governments.

Edward IV of England, supported by Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, won this battle against Henry VI of England, leading to the accession of Edward IV. The battle occurred near Barnet, a small town in Hertfordshire, where Edward led the House of York against the House of Lancaster, backed by Henry VI. Warwick, who had played a crucial role in the succession, defeated his former allies to force Edward to flee for Burgundian Netherlands. Edward IV then invaded England from the Continent, where he met with significant opposition. The Yorkists, under Lord Hastings, defeated the Lancastrians in a dense fog, leading to the final confrontation at Barnet. Edward IV routed the Yorkists on their return, securing the throne for himself.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Niels Henrik David Bohr (1885-1962) was a Danish physicist whose contributions to atomic structure and quantum theory were crucial. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922 for his development of the Bohr model of the atom, which suggests that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that they orbit the atomic nucleus but can jump between different energy levels. Bohr's concept of complementarity states that items cannot be analysed simultaneously, such as being both a wave and a particle. Bohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, now the Niels Bohr Institute, and mentored many scientists, including Hans Kramers, Oskar Klein, George de Hevesy, and Werner Heisenberg. He predicted the existence of hafnium, a new zirconium-like element, and won the Pauling Award in 1957 for his role in promoting scientific research. Bohr is also famous for the Bohr–Van Leeuwen theorem, which describes how the energy levels of electrons around an atom vary in relation to their position in space.

Although she was initially well-armored and fast, her age and inferior size made her unsuitable for active service in World War I, which began in 1914. By then, the British battleship HMS Dreadnought had surpassed her in many respects. So, instead of engaging in battle, she was scheduled to serve as a guard ship during the war. Her fate after the war was complicated by the Treaty of Versailles, allowing the German navy to retain up to eight obsolete battleships. SMS Schlesien finally met an untimely end near Swinemünde in 1945, having been mined and sunk by Soviet forces. She was permanently removed from service in 1949-1956.

Born into the Plantagenet or Angevin kingdom, he lost most of his French lands to Philip II of France during the Angevin Empire's decline. John's young age (1166-1216) and the challenges of succession contributed to the fragmentation of the Angevin Empire. After the death of his brother Richard I, John became the apparent new king, leading to a baronial revolt that culminated in the Magna Carta. John married first Isabella of Gloucester then Isabella of Angoulême, and had two sons, Henry III and Richard. He played a role in the baronial revolts and is buried in Worcester Cathedral. John and Philip II of France had a difficult relationship, marked by the signing of the Treaty of Le Goulet in 1200. John continued to face challenges with France, including the invasions of Normandy in 1204 and the collapse of his empire in northern France in 1206.

Following a census conducted in disputed border communities, Malian forces launched an offensive on 25 December. The Malian forces gained control of most of the Agacher Strip, while Burkinabé forces attempted guerrilla tactics to stall Malian tanks.

Despite these hardships, he continued to write until his death. In his later years, Döblin struggled with mental illness and poverty, though his literary legacy endured through his remaining works.\n        [Translation] <ref>{{Harvnb|Sander|2001|p=9}}</ref>\n        {{Harvnb|Davies|Schonfield|2009|p=1}}</ref>\n\nI don't need you to summarize this article, I just want you to say what it is about.

His reign is highly uncertain and subject to ongoing debate. While his exact reign length is difficult to determine, it is widely believed to have spanned approximately three years, nineteen years, or decades, depending on the interpretation of his reign. Sheshi is best-attested as a king during the end of the Middle Kingdom and the beginning of the Second Intermediate period, around 1800 BC, and is best-known for its association with scaraboids. Several scaraboids seals bearing his name have been found throughout the world, including in the Levant, Egypt, Nubia, and Carthage. Three competing hypotheses exist for the dynasty to which Sheshi belonged: Salitis, Khyan, and Apophis. Some evidence suggests that Sheshi could have ruled over some portion of Egypt or Canaan. The existence of such rulers is debatable, and different scholars have different interpretations of their reign lengths.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Atomic theory is the scientific explanation that matter is composed of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms. The definition of an atom has evolved over time, starting with hypothetical particles smaller than visible matter to being renamed atoms in the context of chemistry. Physicists realized these particles had a fixed structure and could combine in specific ways, leading to the development of atomic theory. This theory is foundational to all physical sciences and has been supported by numerous experiments. Historically, atomic theory has been influenced by philosophical notions such as those of Ancient Greece's Democritus, who proposed that everything is made up of tiny, indivisible particles. Today, we understand atoms as elementary particles consisting of quarks and leptons, following Lebedev's rule. The process of forming a molecule involves combining two or more atoms at a time, as illustrated in the example provided. Atomic theory has evolved to include advancements like nuclear physics and quantum mechanics, where the structure of atoms remains crucial but the processes of formation and interaction between atoms become even more complex. The article also touches on the philosophical implications of atomic theory, including its relationship toalchemy and the origins of scientific knowledge.  {{short_description|none}}",

It has led to the acceptance of many paranormal beliefs and practices, including astrology, fortune telling, aura reading, and personality testing methods like psychometrics.\n        The Barnum effect is an example of the acceptance phenomenon, a general tendency of humans to accept nearly anything as being true or valid, regardless of its validity or reliability. It can occur in various contexts, from scientific experiments to everyday conversation, and is often associated with the idea of \"personal validation,\" which refers to the belief that one's personality can be validated by external observers.\n        In conclusion, the Barnum effect highlights the importance of critical thinking and skepticism in evaluating",

Another relevant phenomenon is subjective validation. Early research in 1947 by psychologist Ross Stagner asked a group of personnel managers to take a personality test, and the results indicated that individuals gave higher ratings to the test results than to a random sample.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Animal husbandry is the science and art of raising animals for their meat, wool, or other products, including their dairy. It involves day-to-day care, management, production, nutrition, selective breeding, and the raising of livestock. The study of animal husbandry dates back to the Neolithic Revolution, before which animals had been domesticated around 13,000 years ago. The Columbian exchange and the British Agricultural Revolution have significantly increased the variety and productivity of different animal species. In developed countries, livestock are typically kept in intensive systems like feedlots and pens, while in developing countries, greater freedom and grazing space are preferred. This raises several environmental issues, including climate change, ocean acidification, and biodiversity loss. Most livestock are herbivores, except for pigs and chickens which are omnivores. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass, while piggis and rabbits cannot digest cellulose in forage. Agriculture as we know it today depends on specific production systems tailored to different types of lands. Subsistence farming is often replaced by intensive animal farming in developing regions, allowing for greater land use efficiency and often higher yields, but at the cost of environmental sustainability. 2.

The book provided empirical evidence supporting this idea, including data from Darwin's *Beagle* expedition and subsequent research. While Lamarckism was also discussed, it was generally seen as less important than natural selection. The book was well received by the scientific community but faced significant opposition from the Church of England and the scientific establishment, which saw the ideas as inconsistent with their beliefs about the transmutation of species. Darwin himself later amended the book to include a section rebutting some of the more controversial claims.

The Cayman Islands were first discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1503 and were initially called \"Las Tortugas\" by Spanish sailors. They were later renamed \"Caimanas\" (alligators) and \"Caymanes\" (to avoid confusion with the nearby island of Grand Cayman). The Territory became a dependency of Jamaica in 1863 and later consolidated under a single administration in 1930. The Cayman Islands' coat of arms was adopted on May 14, 1958, and the flag on May 19, 1959. The use of this flag has continued until the present day.

Articulate brachiopods have toothed hinges and simple, vertical opening/closing muscles, while inarticulate brachiopods have weaker hinges and more complex muscle systems used for maintaining valve alignment. Inarticulate brachiopods have pedicles projecting from their valves, allowing for larval movement through the body cavity.

Different classifications of brachiopods, such as whether they belong to the deuterostomes or the sister group to the chordates, have varying evolutionary relationships.

These modifications can include introducing new genes, enhancing or altering existing genes, or knocking out specific genes. GMOs range from bacteria to plants and animals, each with unique applications. Bacteria and fungi are engineered for various purposes, including research, food production, and industrial applications. Viruses serve as vectors for gene therapy. Plants are engineered for research, new colors, vaccine delivery, and enhanced crops. Animals, particularly mammals, are used as model organisms for human research and are being explored for livestock improvements.

      "base_model_summary": "Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) refer to any living organism whose genetic material has been altered through genetic engineering techniques, which can include introducing new genes or modifying existing ones. The goal of genetic modification is to enhance traits such as resistance to diseases or improved nutritional value, making them suitable for use in agriculture, food production, pharmaceuticals, and beyond. Genetic engineering involves transferring genes between different organisms or within the same species, creating transgenic organisms and manipulating their genomes. The field of biotechnology, including genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry, is constantly evolving, leading to breakthroughs in producing GMOs that could revolutionize various industries. While genetic modification holds great promise for improving human health and productivity, it also raises ethical concerns about the long-term effects and potential risks associated with introducing foreign DNA into ecosystems. Despite its numerous applications, genetic modification remains controversial, with many arguing that it lacks proper regulation and oversight.\nThe summary consists of four paragraphs:\n\n  * The definition of a genetically modified organism (GMO)\n  * The historical development of genetic engineering and its impact on agricultural technology\n  * Current trends and challenges in genetic engineering and its application in agriculture\n  * Ethical considerations surrounding genetic modification and its long-term impacts on society\n\nThis summary captures all key",
      "finetuned_model_summary": "A genetically modified organism (GMO) is any organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering methods. The definition can vary, but a typical GMO involves introducing new genes or enhancing, altering, or knocking out endogenous genes. Genetic modification can include cisgenesis, transgenesis, and crossing with different species. The process typically involves isolating the gene, combining it with other genetic elements, and sometimes using promoters and terminators. Advances in genome editing, such as CRISPR, have made genetic modification more convenient. The first genetically modified organism, a bacterium resistant to kanamycin, was developed in 1973; the first genetically modified animal, a mouse, in 1974; and the first plant, Flavr Savr, in 1983. Genetically modified bacteria, fungi, and viruses have been used in various applications, including gene therapy and vaccine development. Plants are also being engineered for scientific research, coloration, and disease protection. While genetically modified crops have the most controversial GMOs due to their potential for virus removal, many livestock are modified as well. Mammals make up the largest group of model organisms. Livestock are generally easier to transform than humans, making them the focus of most efforts",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Germany–Japan relations are currently and historically bilateral relations involving Germany and Japan. Officially established in 1861 with the first ambassadorial visit, Japan modernized during the Meiji Restoration, often drawing on German models, and Japan aligned with Britain in 1902, leading to early enemy relations in World War I. Both sides escalated their militarism in the 1930s, leading to an alliance with Italy known as the Axis powers. During World War II, they split apart but later re-aligned, with Japan and Germany fighting separate wars until they surrendered separately. Post-WWII, both economies recovered quickly, and they are now the third and fourth largest economies in the world, benefiting from robust cooperation. Germany views Japan positively overall, while Japan views Germany favorably. According to a recent survey, Germany is highly positive towards Japan, and Japan is also highly positive towards Germany. The relationship is complex and multifaceted, influenced by history, politics, economics, and culture. 2023 Bertelsmann Foundation Poll data indicates a balanced German view, with 97% viewing Japan positively and 3% negatively. 93% of Japanese respondents view Germany positively, with 6% viewing it negatively.

Copper is one of the few metals naturally occurring in a metallic form, making it the native metal. Early humans used it for heating and conducting heat, and it was smelted from sulfide ores around 5000 BC, leading to the development of bronze and subsequent alloying with tin for brass and thermocouples. Common compounds include copper(II) salts, which give minerals their distinctive colors. Copper is also used in buildings for roofing, where it oxidizes to form verdigris, a brown pigment. In decorative art, it is used to make patterns like those on jewelry and coins.

Players design and build vehicles, completing levels across various worlds using the Havok physics engine. The game offers both single-player and multiplayer modes, with multiplayer being more exclusive due to restrictions imposed by Microsoft. Despite receiving mixed reviews upon initial release, it gained recognition as a groundbreaking entry into the platform-game genre, particularly for its innovative vehicle-building mechanics. ``Nuts & Bolts'' continues to be enjoyed by fans of classic ''Banjo-Kazooie'' games. The game's unique blend of exploration, construction, and management challenges set it apart from other ''Banjo-Kazooie'' games. In the decade since its release, it has become a cult classic, influencing later generations of game developers, particularly those focused on vehicle creation and management.

      "reference_summary": "Millipedes, scientifically known as Diplopoda, are arthropods characterized by having two pairs of legs per body segment. They have elongated cylindrical or flattened bodies and belong to one of 16 orders and around 140 families, with about 12,000 named species. Despite their name, which means \"thousand feet,\" no millipede species was known to have over 1,000 legs until the discovery of Eumillipes persephone in 2020, which can have over 1,300 legs. Millipedes are primarily detritivores, feeding on decaying plant matter, though some consume fungi or drink plant fluids. They defend themselves using chemical secretions and by curling into a tight coil. Reproduction involves the use of specialized male legs called gonopods to transfer sperm to females. Millipedes first appeared in the Silurian period and are among the oldest known land animals, with some prehistoric species reaching up to 2 meters in length. The largest current species, the giant African millipede, measures up to 38 cm. Their study is known as diplopodology. Millipedes are often confused with centipedes, which differ by moving faster, being venomous, carnivorous, and having only one pair of legs per segment. The scientific name \"Diplopoda\" comes from the fusion of two single segments to form each double-legged segment. Some molecular studies suggest that pauropods may not be the closest relatives to millipedes despite traditional beliefs. Millipedes can be pests in greenhouses, damaging emerging seedlings. They curl into a tight coil when threatened to protect their vulnerable parts. The term \"millipede\" is widely used, but some North American scientists prefer \"milliped.\" ",

They are known scientifically as the class Diplopoda, after the Greek word for \"thousand\". There are approximately 12,000 named species and about 140 families. Millipedes are typically slow-moving detritivores that feed on decaying plant material, including fungi and leaf litter. Many millipedes are small but can grow up to over 38 cm long in some species. They are not aggressive against people, although their venomous bites can be painful.

The band recorded an album featuring a controversial photo of a topless 11-year-old girl on the front cover, which received different publicity in the U.S. Despite this, they initially played concerts in Scandinavia and the U.S., but the lack of material made them perform old Cream and Traffic songs instead, which didn't fully satisfy the audience.

Both served the Regia Marina until 1943, when 'Lubiana' was lost. 'Sebenico' was seized by Germany and renamed 'TA43', which was reportedly lost in the war's final weeks. In 1973, President Josip Broz Tito posthumously honored the officers who scuttled 'Zagreb' with the Order of the People's Hero. The class featured standard destroyer specifications, including four 120mm guns and torpedo tubes. They had a displacement of 1210 tons and a top speed of 35 knots.

Gilbert also wrote several plays and collaborates with other collaborators, including Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. He dies in poor health and is knighted in 1907. The work of Gilbert and Sullivan continues to influence American musical theatre, particularly",

It was originally described as a genus of diopod, meaning \"double-beam\". In 1901, John Bell Hatcher classified ''Diplodocus carnegii'' as being descended from a group of other diopods called ''D. hallorum''. Since its discovery, ''Diplodocus'' has become one of the most famous dinosaurs in the world, featuring cast collections in many major museums worldwide.\n        The genus belongs to the family Diplodocaenidae, also known as the Sauropoda. It had a distinctive appearance for a sauropod, with a very long neck and a very long tail.

Main-sequence stars, including the Sun, are characterized by nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in their cores, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium. The position of a star on the main sequence depends on its mass, chemical composition, and age. Stars below 1.5 solar masses use the proton-proton chain to generate energy, while those above use the CNO cycle. Heavier stars have shorter lifespans on the main sequence.

Addition is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, along with subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is defined for natural numbers and extends to integers, real numbers, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, subspaces, and subgroups. Addition follows certain properties, including commutativity and associativity. There are different notations and terminologies used to represent addition, such as the Plus and Minus signs and the plus sign. Addition is fundamental in computing and daily life, especially for children who learn simple math concepts through age-appropriate methods like the abacus. It's also applied in algebra, where addition operates on abstract elements such as Euclidean vectors, matrices, and groups.

Addition is used to combine two whole numbers to find their sum, as shown in the example above. It can also be defined and executed using abstract numbers like integers, real numbers, and complex numbers. Addition is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operands doesn't matter, and the grouping of terms doesn't affect the outcome. Zero times any number remains unchanged, and adding 1 to a number does not change it. Addition obeys rules for handling different types of operations like subtraction and multiplication. Basic addition skills are essential for younger children and are implemented through various technological tools. The process involves writing additions in infix notation, with operators on either side of the operand. Notable examples include 1 + 2 = 3 and 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. Advanced techniques involve understanding addition in contexts like vectors, matrices, subspaces, and subgroups. The concept is crucial for many fields including science, engineering, and finance.

Named after its migratory behavior, it was known for its enormous flocks, reaching speeds up to 100 km/h while feeding on mast, fruits, and invertebrates. Sexually dimorphic, males were larger and more colorful than females. Despite being the most abundant bird in North America, with estimates of up to 5 billion individuals, the species was driven to extinction by intensive commercial hunting, loss of habitat due to deforestation, and reduced breeding populations. The last known passenger pigeon died in captivity in 1914. Genetic studies indicate its closest relatives are within the genus Patagioenas rather than the mourning dove. The species highlights the devastating impact of human activities on wildlife populations.",
      "base_model_summary": "The passenger pigeon, a migratory pigeon originally found in North America, became extinct in 1914 due to overhunting and habitat loss. Its morphological similarity to the mourning dove led some scientists to mistake them as the same species, which caused confusion between the two genera. Genetic evidence suggests that the genus Patagioenas is more closely related to the passenger pigeon than Zenaida doves. Passenger pigeons had a diverse diet of mast, fruit, and insects, and migrated in huge flocks. They were known for their communal roosting and breeding practices, which allowed them to find food and reduce predation. While they were considered one of North America's most abundant birds, their decline contributed to significant population declines in later years, leading to their eventual extinction in the early 20th century. \n\nThe end of the passenger pigeon represents a critical moment in North American bird history. It marks the end of the [[Endangered Species Act|EPA]']s efforts to protect the species, and it is likely to cause another extinction event in the future.

It was known for its migratory nature and was often referred to as the \"passing bird\" because of its reproductive cycles. The male was 390 to 410 mm in length, with a distinctive light to dark iridescent plumage and black spots on the wings. The female was smaller, about 380 to 400 mm in length. The species lived in deciduous forests and was commonly found around Great Lakes. The pigeon was known for its high flight ability and was a key indicator species for biodiversity in North America during the early 20th century. However, habitat loss, including urbanization and deforestation, played a significant role in its extinction. The species was listed as extinct in 1914 according to the IUCN Red List. The exact cause of extinction remains debated, but it is considered to be a combination of human activity and environmental degradation. The pigeon's rapid reproduction rate and social structure made it challenging to manage sustainably, leading to cascading effects throughout the ecosystem. 2010's movie \"Passenger Pigeons\" has contributed to raising awareness",

Although traditionally grouped under the more basal Bilateria, recent studies show them to be a primitive stage in the evolution of bilaterians, belonging to a separate branch of the evolutionary tree rather than being closely related to any other modern groups.\n        Explanation: The article discusses the classification and characteristics of the phylum Platyhelminthes, including its placement within the larger category of bilaterian organisms. It highlights the unique features of these animals, such as their flattened shape, lack of specialized organs, and reliance on diffusion for nutrient absorption.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The article discusses the phylum Platyhelminthes, which includes a diverse group of bilaterian, unsegmented, soft-bodied invertebrates known as flatworms or flat worms. These animals are acoelomates, meaning they have no body cavity, and therefore cannot be fully characterized by a single classification scheme like other bilaterians. Traditional classifications into groups like Turbellaria (non-parasitic animals) are deprecated, as these days, most flatworms are assumed to be parasites. Free-living flatworms typically live in water or on moist terrestrial surfaces, while cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes) have complex life cycles involving intermediaries. The larvae of trematodes detach from their hosts before being expelled, while those of cestodes metamorphose into adults. Because flatworms do not have internal body cavities, they were initially considered a primitive stage in the evolution of bilaterians. However, more recent analyses have shown that they represent a more evolved group closer to bilaterians than to other modern groups. The article also clarifies that Platyhelminthes is part of the kingdom Ecdysozoa, which includes other phyla like Cten",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The \"Catalogue of Women\" (Γυναικῶν Κατάλογος) is a fragmentary Greek epic poem attributed to Hesiod during antiquity. It describes the lives of female heroes who bore the male heroes to both divine and mortal paramours. Unlike Homer and Odysseus's Iliad and Odyssey, which focus on narrative, this poem is structured around genealogies and involves many characters. Scholars doubt it was written by Hesiod but question its authenticity, offering insights into the roles and perceptions of women in Greek culture and society. The poem provides evidence for the Hellenic world as a map of genealogical relationships and systems of kinship. Despite its decline in popularity, the poem is well-documented and available via papyrus fragments and ancient authors. 1,300 copies exist, demonstrating its accessibility even in medieval manuscripts.  The \"Catalogue\" serves as a transitional text between the divine world of Homer and the terrestrial concerns of the Odyssey by preserving information about complex kinship structures that continued to influence politics long after the Archaic period.  Key themes include the roles of women, gender roles, and the societal expectations surrounding them during this period. The poem's",

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The Silesian Wars were three conflicts between Prussia and the Habsburg monarchy in the mid-18th century, primarily focusing on the control of Silesia. These wars, part of the broader Austro-Prussian rivalry, pitted Prussia against the other major land powers of the time, including the Holy Roman Empire, the French Kingdom, and the Russian Empire. Key battles include the First Silesian War (1740-1742) and the Second Silesian War (1744-1745), both of which resulted in Prussia's victory. The war also saw Prussia gain control of significant portions of Silesia, which had previously been ceded to Austria by the Habsburg monarchy. The Third Silesian War (1756-1763) marked a turning point in the conflict, involving Austria leading another coalition to seize Prussian territory.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "\"The Long and Winding Road\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1970 album \"Let It Be\". Written by Paul McCartney and Lennon–McCartney, it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The song's main recording occurred in January 1969 at Apple and EMI in London, with a sparse musical arrangement featuring piano, bass, guitar and percussion. To prepare for release in April 1970, Phil Spector added orchestral and choral overdubs. This led to a dispute over the treatment of the song, which was later resolved through legal means. The song's inspiration came from a visit to Paul McCartney's property in Scotland, where he saw a road stretching into the hills. The lyrics are about a person traveling along a winding road, symbolizing the challenges and uncertainties of life. The song has since become one of the Beatles' most beloved and popular works.

This site is one of the best known examples of early hunter-gatherer art in South America and has been studied for decades by Argentine archaeologists Carlos J. Gradin and his team. The cave and complex of rock art sites, known as the \"Cueva de las Manos,\" are located at the base of a stepped cliff in the Pinturas River Canyon, near the upper part of the Desierto de Fuego basin. The paintings were made in several waves between 7,300 BC and 700 AD, using bone pipes to spray paint the designs onto the cave walls. The site is considered by some scholars to be the best material evidence of early South American hunter-gatherer groups. The research on the site began in 1964 by Carlos J. Gradin and his team, who have continued to excavate the site throughout the years. The cave is a National Historic Monument in Argentina and a UNESCO World Heritage Site",

Discovered by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello in 1998, RNAi has emerged as a powerful tool for gene regulation, offering advantages like efficiency, stability, and specificity over antisense therapies. Small ribonucleic acids (miRNA and siRNA) are crucial components of the RNAi pathway. They prevent mRNA degradation through post-transcriptional silencing and inhibit transcription via pre-transcriptional silencing through Argonaute 2. The RNAi pathway is nature-inspired and operates in eukaryotic and animal cells, initiating with the cleavage of dsRNA into siRNAs by Dicer, which are then processed by Ago2 to form RISC. The RISC assembly then degrades the target mRNA, specifically targeting those with complementary sequences to the siRNA or siRNA-guiding strand.

They form in various climates, from arid to humid, and can range from small to vast sizes. Alluvial fans are created when flow from a confined channel spreads out and infiltrates the surface, reducing its carrying capacity and causing sediment deposition. They are common in the geologic record and have been found on other planets like Mars and Titan. Some of the largest alluvial fans are found along the Himalayan mountain front, and shifts in feeder channels can lead to catastrophic flooding. The shape and size of alluvial fans can vary greatly, with the steepest slope near the apex and becoming less steep further out. Unconfined fans allow sediments to naturally fan out, while confined fans are influenced by topographic barriers. Toe-trimmed fans, marked by a small escarpment, can record climate changes or tectonic processes.",

Sediments are usually coarse and poorly sorted, and coarse sediments are often found on the proximal fan.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) is an European species of goat found in the Alps. It is sexually dimorphic, with males larger and longer horns than females. It has a brownish-grey coat and is known for scaling steep mountains. Alpine ibexes are typically found in rugged terrain and open meadows, with elevations up to 3300 meters. They are social animals but separate during the breeding season to avoid conflict. The species has faced extirpation and a population bottleneck, but has since been reintroduced to parts of its historical range. Today's individuals descend from Gran Paradiso National Park, Italy. The Alpine ibex was last extirpated most of its historical range, and it has faced several conservation issues, including habitat loss and fragmentation. The IUCN lists it as being of least concern due to successful reintroductions to some areas. The species' exact origin is unknown, but it may have originated in Central Asia and spread to Europe, the Caucasus, and East Africa during the Plio-Pleistocene. The genus Capra includes other goat species, and the specific name \"ibex\" refers to this particular species. The fossil record suggests that the genus may have originated in Central Asia.",

Lakoba saw that Abkhazia was initially granted independence as a socialist Soviet Republic before being formally incorporated into the Georgian SSR. Despite this, he was forced to accept a lower status than necessary in order to align with Soviet ideology. In 1936, he succumbed to a poisoning incident, allowing Soviet authorities to consolidate their control over the region and discredit him and his family. Rehabilitated after his death in 1953, Lakoba is now considered a national hero in Abkhazia.

Captain Sir Edward Pellew's actions led to the destruction of the French ship Droits de l'Homme, which resulted in over 1,000 deaths. This defeat marked the end of the French expedition to Ireland and the beginning of the French Revolutionary Wars. \n\n        I am not sure how accurate you think my summary is.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "The French expedition to Ireland, known as the \"Expédition d'Irlande,\" was an unsuccessful attempt by the French Republic to assist the Society of United Irishmen in their rebellion against British rule during the French Revolutionary Wars. The French, led by General Lazare Hoche, set out from Brest in late 1796 with a force of 15,000 to 20,000 men. They planned to land a large force in Christmas 1797, but the weather conditions made the landing impossible, leading to dispersion and possible disintegration of the French fleet. The British, mainly composed of naval vessels, managed to intercept and capture several French warships without much difficulty, with minor losses on the French side. The French, however, suffered heavy losses, including 2,230 deaths or drownings, 1,000 captures, and 12 warships destroyed or damaged. The campaign did not achieve the expected outcome, failing to succeed in driving the British out of Ireland or in preparing for potential invasion of Great Britain. The Directory had collected about 15,000 troops at Brest and sent them to France for a major landing at Bantry Bay in December",

      "reference_summary": "A castle is a fortified structure built during the Middle Ages by nobility or royalty in Europe, serving as a private residence and fortress. Unlike mansions, palaces, and villas, which were mainly for pleasure, castles had defensive purposes. Castles varied widely in form but commonly featured curtain walls, arrow slits, and portcullises. Originating in the 9th and 10th centuries following the collapse of the Carolingian Empire, castles were constructed by individual lords to exert control over their territories. They functioned as military bases for launching raids, administrative centers, and symbols of power. Often initially built from earth and timber, many were later fortified with stone. Castles were strategically located near resources essential to the community, such as mills, fertile land, and water sources. Their construction aimed to control local populations and important travel routes. Examples include the Alcázar of Segovia in Spain and Bodiam Castle in England. Over time, the term \"castle\" has been applied more broadly, including hill forts and 19th- and 20th-century homes resembling castles. Post-medieval \"pleasances\" were built to mimic castles, serving as \"landscape propaganda\" to affirm noble status. ",

These were commonly used by noble families as residences and were often surrounded by water-filled moats. Examples include the Alcázar de Segovia in Spain and the Bodiam Castle in England. Castles were primarily intended as landscape propaganda and were never fully constructed as defensive structures. While some castle buildings have been modified over time, others have survived intact due to historical events and wars. The use of stone and other materials like lime and sandstone allowed for more efficient construction methods. Despite their practicality, castles were initially considered luxurious residences and were often decorated with ornate designs. Some examples of medieval castles include the Alcázar de Segovia in Spain and the Bodiam Castle in England. Their unique architectural styles evolved over centuries and continue to be studied today.\nThis summary encapsulates the key elements of the article, providing context about the definition of a medieval castle, describing its characteristics, and explaining its significance within medieval European history and architecture.

It can be considered the private fortified residence of a lord or noble. Key characteristics include pink walls with a sculptural pattern, various turrets, and detailed decoration. The Alcázar of Segovia in Spain and Bodiam Castle in England are two notable examples. The Alcázar is a example of a castle's early development, while Bodiam Castle is an example of a more complete structure. European-style castles emerged after the Carolingian Empire fell, with nobles building castles to control nearby areas and as administrative and defensive centers. They often had offensive and defensive features, serving both as bases for raids and as protection from enemies. Northern European castles were typically built from earth and timber with stone replacing earlier materials, often exploiting natural defences. Key dates include the 9th and 10th centuries, marked by the fall of the Carolingian Empire and the division of territories among lords. The architecture evolved over time, with advancements in stone masonry and interior design. 650 years after the fall of the Carolingian Empire, the Roman empire was founded, leading to a significant change in architectural",

It is part of the Katla volcanic chain and consists of segments of rifts and fissures. The largest effusive eruption in recent history occurred around 939 CE, covering approximately 780 km² of land and releasing 18.6 km³ of lava.

The Eldgjá eruption is part of a larger volcanic cycle in Iceland, influenced by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Iceland hotspot, and has resulted in the formation of the country's distinctive volcanic zones. Large eruptions like those of Þjórsá Lava in the early Holocene have been attributed to the unloading of the crust by melting ice. The exact role of the Eldgjá eruption in influencing the current volcanic activity remains debated. 8,600 years ago, a massive event occurred in the area, possibly related to the release of magma or thermal anomalies. 939 CE was marked by the largest effusive eruption in recent history.

The design influenced the subsequent Ersatz Yorck class, which was intended to have even larger 38 cm guns. Construction began in 1914, but the ships were never completed. The class was a response to British naval advancements, particularly the Admiral-class battlecruisers. Key specifications included a standard displacement of 31,000 tons, a length of 223 meters, and a maximum speed of 28 knots.

The specimen consists of five cervical vertebrae (neck) along with some other structures, and it was initially described as a cervical vertebra named C5-C9. However, recent studies suggest that the specimen is not a cervical vertebra but rather a phasmid. The author notes that the cervical vertebrae were originally categorized as C1-C6 based on the description of the holotype. The specimen was reclassified as C8 and C7 due to the size and shape of the vertebra. This suggests that the specimen represents a new genus called ``Phosphatodraco'' which belongs to the class of azhdarchids.

A second species, \"A. crassum\", was later identified in 1977 based on tooth fragments. The genus has been historically placed in the families Mesonychidae or Arctocyonidae, but is now regarded as a distinct family, Andrewsarchaeida. It is closely related to whales and has been suggested to be a close relative of them. The genus includes one known species, Andrewsarchus, which has been found in China and possibly elsewhere in Asia. The skull of \"A. mongoliensis\" is notable for its robust, elongated neck and large ears, while those of \"A. crassum\" are smaller and more streamlined. The genus also includes several synapomorphies, including \"Paratriisodon\" and \"Paratriisodon henanensis\". The taxonomic classification of Andrewsarchus is currently under review",
