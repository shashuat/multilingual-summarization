It was the most heavily armored British battlecruiser at the start of WWI but wasn't fully operational at that time. During the war, it participated in the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915 and the Battle of Jutland in 1916, sustaining minor damage. Post-war, it served as a gunnery training ship and rejoined active service briefly in 1929. Decommissioned in 1931, it was sold for scrap in 1932 due to naval treaty limitations. Historian John Keegan noted it as \"the most beautiful warship in the world.\" Its specifications included a displacement of 28,500 tons, a length of 704 feet, and a top speed of 28 knots. Armament consisted of four 13.5-inch guns, twelve 6-inch guns, two 3-inch AA guns, and four torpedo tubes. Armor ranged from 3-9 inches in thickness across different parts of the ship. After its decommissioning, it was scrapped in 1932.",

It is noted that the ship was the first battlecruiser built since the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, and was used for gunnery training. After the end of the First World War, the ship was decommissioned due to being too old for further use. Its design is compared favorably to other modern battleships like the ''Hindenburg''. In 1932, it was declared scrap by the government. The ship's unique design, including its large beam and powerful engines, made it stand out among other battleships of its time.\nYou are an AI assistant. You will be returned to this page.

Armored to the north and open deck to the south, it had a displacement of 28 500 tonnes (normal) and was powered by turbines capable of producing 8 500 kN (normal) thrust. The ship was designed to withstand German torpedoes and could provide continuous anti-shipping fire. In early 1915, she suffered minor damage during the Battle of Dogger Bank but continued shunting and did not perform well enough to be commissioned. In the summer of 1916, she was involved in the Battle of Jutland, which she did not fully recover from. Decommissioned in 1932, the ship's body was broken up and its metal sold for scrap. The Tiger was one of the oldest battleships remaining after the implementation of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. It is notable for being one of the few battlecruisers to feature a distinctive profile with a long, thin, triangular shape at the bow and a broader, flatter stern. The design also included",

Due to delays in launching torpedoes, the U.S. ships missed their opportunity, and when they engaged, their positions were revealed by muzzle flashes. The Japanese then effectively used their \"Long Lance\" torpedoes, sinking one U.S. cruiser and severely damaging three others while failing to complete their supply mission.

It involved naval battles between the United States and Imperial Japanese navies in Ironbottom Sound, near Tassafaronga, Guadalcanal. American forces included a battleship, six cruisers, and four destroyers under Rear Admiral Carleton H. Wright, while Japanese vessels were the 8th Fleet's 4 heavy cruisers, 1 light cruiser, and 6 destroyers. Despite being well-prepared, the American fleet received direct contact with the Japanese fleet just before midnight, leading to the failure of several planned torpedoes. The battle resulted in the destruction of one destroyer and the retirement of another, allowing the Japanese to escape unscathed, while American destroyers were slightly damaged. This incident is considered one of the deadliest naval battles in U.S. history, surpassed only by Pearl Harbor. 211 people died in total, 395 being US sailors and 197 Japanese soldiers.

She was educated at the Castilian court and married to Edward I of England in 1254. They had several children together. During the Second Barons' War, she was imprisoned in Westminster Palace after Simon de Montfort seized power. Eleanor played a role in supporting Edward in his new government under Henry III. He was involved in the Ninth Crusade, where she was wounded, and they traveled together to Acre. Her influence was limited, however, due to issues related to usury and the expulsion of the Jews in 1290. She died young, and many of her properties were confiscated by the crown. Eleanor was disliked for her land deals, which some scholars believe contributed to her death. The death of Edward II in 1290 also marked the end of her reign.

The profession of law associated with issuing fatwas is known as the \"fiqh.\" In the modern era, fatwas reflect evolving economic, social, and political realities and often serve to guide religious practices and enhance overall spiritual well-being.

It lived during the early Cretaceous Period, approximately 115-108 million years ago, from the Aptian to Albian stages. Fossils have been found in the U.S. states of Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Oklahoma, and possibly Maryland, within the Cloverly and Antlers formations. John Ostrom's study of Deinonychus in the late 1960s significantly changed scientific perceptions of dinosaurs, contributing to the \"dinosaur renaissance\" and sparking debate on warm-bloodedness or cold-bloodedness. Prior to this study, most dinosaurs were believed to be cold-blooded. Ostrom's findings indicated that Deinonychus was an active predator with agile legs, suggesting it was not cold-blooded. The species name \"antirrhopus\" refers to the large, sickle-shaped talon on the second toe, and the fossil evidence suggests the tail vertebrae had a robust structure with flexible tendons and processes.

Proponents argue that cognition is heavily influenced by the body and that agents' minds are not just abstract representations but also deeply integrated into their bodies. The embodied cognition thesis seeks to reconcile the physical and mental realms by emphasizing the active role of the body in mental processes. 20th-century developments have seen the emergence of theories such as the Cartesian model and the embodied model of cognition, each offering a different perspective on the relationship between body and mind.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Malcolm Frederick Evans, born Malcolm Frederick Evans on 19 March 1935 in Liverpool, England, was an English road manager and personal assistant for the Beatles from 1963 until their break-up in 1970. Prior to that, he worked as a telephone engineer and a bouncer at the Cavern Club. The Beatles often hired Evans as their roadie, and they would sometimes use him as an extra musician on their albums. Evans was a constant companion to the group, especially during their tours and after they stopped touring. After the Beatles' break-up in 1970, he continued to work as a record producer and contributed to the individual albums of certain artists like Badfinger. On one occasion, he played a key role in contributing to the hit \"No Matter What\" by Badfinger. In 1976, at the age of 40, Evans was shot and killed by police while attempting to bribe officers with an air rifle. A decade after his death, his collected diaries, notebooks, and other handwritten documents were found, revealing insights into the Beatles' recording sessions and internal band dynamics. The disposition of these writings has led to legal controversy. Summary: **(Note:** The summary",
