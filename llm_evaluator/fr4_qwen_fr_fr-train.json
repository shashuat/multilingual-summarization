      "explanation": "Summary A is quite poor. It focuses almost entirely on dimensions and includes some strange phrasing ('214 mètres d'épaisseur'). It mentions some armament but lacks context and overall historical significance. It feels like a collection of data points rather than a summary. Summary B, on the other hand, is almost identical to the reference summary. It accurately conveys the ship's history, participation in key battles, and technical details regarding its speed and design. It is complete, clear, and concise, making it a very strong summary.",

      "explanation": "Summary A contains inaccuracies and is less clear. The mention of 'sévérité de la bataille de Talikota' is vague and doesn't clearly explain the independence of Mysore. The focus on specific rulers (Chamaraja Wodeyar I & IV) feels misplaced and doesn't contribute to a broader understanding of the kingdom's history. The phrasing is also awkward in places. Summary B, however, closely follows the reference text, accurately presenting the key events and figures (Haidar Ali, Tipu Sultan, the British). While it has minor phrasing issues ('se retrouvent derrière les barreaux' is a strange way to phrase Haidar Ali's rise), it is much more factually accurate, complete, and readable than Summary A. It successfully condenses the information while retaining the core historical narrative.",

The claim about damaging dogs during training is completely unfounded and detracts from the summary's credibility. It also introduces information about protection of the race and animal welfare that isn't present in the reference text. While it touches on the breed's origins and uses, it's disorganized and less focused. Summary B, on the other hand, is much closer to the reference text. It accurately reflects the origin, characteristics, uses, and health concerns of the Pur-sang. It's well-written, clear, and concise, covering the key points effectively. It's not *perfect* as it's slightly verbose, but it's a strong summary overall.",

Summary B, however, is much more accurate and closely follows the reference text. It captures the key events, the timeline, and the significance of the movement, including the Shaheed Minar. While it could be slightly more concise, it is a strong and reliable summary. It does have a minor error stating the Shaheed Minar was built in 1952 (it was built later), but it's less damaging than the errors in Summary A.",

It repeats 'bec rouge' unnecessarily and includes a lot of irrelevant information about classification (with strange formatting and links) that doesn't contribute to a summary of the bird itself. It also incorrectly states there are only two subspecies. Summary B, on the other hand, is almost a direct copy of the reference text, making it a perfect summary in terms of accuracy, completeness, and clarity.

It incorrectly states Manchester United is part of Manchester City Football Club and refers to Rúben Amorim as 'the brother of Manchester City'. It also mischaracterizes Old Trafford as an 'hotel'. The list format is awkward and includes redundant information. Summary B, while not perfect, is much more accurate and closely reflects the information in the reference text. It correctly identifies key facts like the founding year, stadium, and some of the club's achievements. It's reasonably concise and readable, though the inclusion of the website link feels slightly out of place in a summary. The statement about 'English owner and British company' is vague but not incorrect.

The connection to Kalamata is also presented confusingly. It's concise but sacrifices accuracy. Summary B, on the other hand, closely mirrors the reference summary in terms of factual accuracy and completeness. It includes key details like the length, cities connected, ongoing construction, and even mentions the counties the route traverses. It's slightly longer but provides a much more comprehensive and reliable overview of the A1 autoroute. While it could be more concise, its accuracy and detail earn it a higher score.",

It also includes extraneous information about a painting and the UK as a 'country of free rights' which is irrelevant to the core topic. The repetition of information from the 'origin' section adds to the lack of conciseness. Summary B, on the other hand, is almost identical to the reference summary, demonstrating excellent factual accuracy, completeness, clarity, and conciseness. The added information about its evolution and dissolution/re-establishment is a valuable addition, though slightly beyond the core request, it doesn't detract from the quality.

The phrasing is awkward ('colonisations et navigatements ont eu une influence positive'), and the statement about increased residence space is vague and unsupported. It feels like a collection of keywords rather than a coherent summary. Summary B, on the other hand, is a very good summary. It accurately reflects the key information from the reference text, including the scientific name, family, habitat, diet, subspecies, and historical context. It's well-written, clear, and concise, though it cuts off abruptly at the end. It maintains a good level of detail without being overly verbose.

It also repeats information unnecessarily and includes irrelevant commentary about the historian Royer and the text's potential incompleteness. The writing is confusing and lacks clarity. Summary B, while not perfect, is much more accurate and closely follows the information presented in the reference text. It correctly identifies his predecessors and successors, probable parentage, and mentions his burial site. It also acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding his lineage.

It incorrectly states the club is Iranian, overemphasizes the women's teams (not mentioned in the reference), and lists an excessive and partially incorrect roster of players. It also repeats information about the 2024-2025 championship as both a recent recognition and a current participation. Summary B is much more accurate, closely following the information in the reference text. It correctly identifies the club as Iraqi, mentions key achievements, and lists notable figures. While it adds some details not explicitly in the reference (stadium size, colors), these are reasonable additions and don't detract from the accuracy. It is well-written and relatively concise.

It incorrectly states Eisenberg plays Marcel Marceau in 'Batman v Superman' (he plays Lex Luthor) and repeats 'Insaisissables' multiple times. It also lists 'Insaisissables' as a series of films when it's a single film series. The phrasing is a bit clunky. Summary B, on the other hand, is almost identical to the reference summary, demonstrating excellent factual accuracy, completeness, clarity, and conciseness. The added information about TCM.com and his reaction to nationality controversies is a minor addition that doesn't detract from the overall quality.
