Initial treatment is with [[intravenous fluid]]s and [[antibiotic]]s, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or [[Stenosis|narrowing]] in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of [[endoscopy]] to relieve obstruction of the bile duct.<ref name=Kinney/><ref name=Williams/> The word is from Greek ''chol''-, bile + ''ang''-, vessel + -''itis'', [[inflammation]].\\n\\n==Signs and symptoms==\\n[[File:Charcot's cholangitis triad-en.svg|thumb|[[Charcot's cholangitis triad|Charcot's triad]]]]\\nA person with cholangitis may complain of [[abdominal pain]] (particularly in the [[right upper quadrant (abdomen)|right upper quadrant]] of the [[Human abdomen|abdomen]]), [[fever]], [[rigor (medicine)|rigors]] (uncontrollable shaking) and a feeling of uneasiness ([[malaise]]).

Bile is formed in the liver by [[hepatocyte]]s (liver cells) and excreted into the [[common hepatic duct]]. Part of the bile is stored in the [[gall bladder]] because of back pressure (exerted by the [[sphincter of Oddi]]), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the [[duodenum]] (first part of the small intestine) through the [[common bile duct]] and the [[ampulla of Vater]]. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and [[pancreas|pancreatic]] [[Pancreatic juice|secretions]] into the digestive tract.<ref name=Kinney/>\\n\\nThe biliary tree is normally relatively free of bacteria because of certain protective mechanisms. The sphincter of Oddi acts as a mechanical barrier.

This involves the use of [[endoscopy]] (passing a tube through the mouth into the [[esophagus]], [[stomach]] and thence to the [[duodenum]]) to pass a small cannula into the bile duct. At that point, [[radiocontrast]] is injected to opacify the duct, and [[X-ray]]s are taken to get a visual impression of the biliary system. On the endoscopic image of the ampulla, one can sometimes see a protuberant ampulla from an impacted gallstone in the common bile duct or the frank extrusion of pus from the common bile duct orifice.

He was a leading member of the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement in the early 20th century, famous for both his political activism and his writing.\\n\\nBerkman was born into a wealthy [[Jewish]] family in [[Vilnius|Vilna]] in the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]) and emigrated to the United States in 1888. He lived in [[New York City]], where he became involved in the anarchist movement. He was the one-time lover and lifelong friend of anarchist [[Emma Goldman]]. In 1892, undertaking an act of [[propaganda of the deed]], Berkman made a failed attempt to assassinate businessman [[Henry Clay Frick]] during the [[Homestead strike]], for which he served 14 years in prison. His experience in prison was the basis of his first book, ''[[Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist]]''.\\n\\nAfter his release from prison, Berkman served as editor of Goldman's anarchist journal, ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]'', and later established his own journal, ''[[The Blast (magazine)|The Blast]]''. In 1917, Berkman and Goldman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiracy against the newly instated [[Conscription in the United States|draft]]. After their release from prison, they were arrested—along with hundreds of others—and deported to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]]. Initially supportive of that country's [[October Revolution|Bolshevik revolution]], Berkman and Goldman soon became disillusioned, voicing their opposition to the Soviets' use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries. They left the Soviet Union in late 1921, and in 1925 Berkman published a book about his experiences, ''[[The Bolshevik Myth]]''.\\n\\nWhile living in [[French Third Republic|France]], Berkman continued his work in support of the anarchist movement, producing the classic exposition of anarchist principles ''[[Now and After: The ABC of Communist Anarchism]]''. Suffering from ill health, Berkman took his own life in 1936.\\n\\n==Life==\\n\\n===Early years===\\nBerkman was born '''Ovsei Osipovich Berkman''' in the [[Lithuania]]n city of [[Vilnius]] (then called Vilna, and part of the [[Vilna Governorate]] in the [[Russian Empire]]).{{Sfnm|1a1=Newell|1y=1977|1p=v|2a1=Walter|2y=1989|2p=vii}} He was the youngest of four children born into a well-off [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] family.

The family moved to [[Saint Petersburg]], a city previously off-limits to Jews.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|p=8}} There, Ovsei adopted the more Russian name Alexander; he was known among family and friends as Sasha, a diminutive for Alexander.{{Sfn|Walter|1989|p=vii}} The Berkmans lived comfortably, with servants and a summer house. Berkman attended the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'', where he received a classical education with the youth of Saint Petersburg's elite.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|p=8}}\\n\\nAs a youth, Berkman was influenced by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, as it turned out—that the tsar's death might result in repression of the Jews and other minorities, Berkman became intrigued by the radical ideas of the day, including [[Narodnik|populism]] and [[Nihilist movement|nihilism]]. He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother [[Mark Natanson]], was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=9–11}}\\n\\nSoon after Berkman turned 12, his father died. The business had to be sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to [[Kaunas|Kovno]], where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise as a student at the ''gymnasium'', but his studies began to falter as he spent his time reading novels. One of the books that interested him was [[Ivan Turgenev]]'s novel ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'' (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. But what truly moved him was [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]]'s influential 1863 novel, ''[[What Is to Be Done? (novel)|What Is to Be Done?]]'', and Berkman felt inspired by [[Rakhmetov]], its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal pleasure and family ties in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=11–13}}\\n\\nSoon, Berkman joined a group at school that was reading and discussing revolutionary literature, which was prohibited under the new tsar, [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. He distributed banned material to other students and wrote some radical tracts of his own, which he printed using supplies pilfered from the school. He turned in a paper titled \"There Is No God\", which resulted in a one-year demotion as punishment on the basis of \"precocious godlessness, dangerous tendencies and subordination\".{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=13–14}}\\n\\nBerkman's mother died in 1887, and his uncle Nathan Natanson became responsible for him. Berkman had contempt for Natanson for his desire to maintain order and avoid conflict. Natanson could not understand what Berkman found appealing in his radical ideas, and he worried that Berkman would bring shame to the family. Late that year, Berkman was caught stealing copies of the school exams and bribing a handyman. He was expelled and labelled a \"nihilist conspirator\".{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|p=14}}\\n\\nBerkman decided to emigrate to the [[United States]]. When his brother left for [[German Empire|Germany]] in early 1888 to study medicine, Berkman took the opportunity to accompany him and from there made his way to [[New York City]].{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=18–19}}\\n\\n===New York City===\\n[[File:Alexander Berkman, 1892.jpg|thumb|Berkman in 1892]]\\nSoon after his arrival in New York, where he knew no one and spoke no English, Berkman became an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] through his involvement with groups that had formed to campaign to free the men convicted of the 1886 [[Haymarket affair|Haymarket bombing]]. He joined the [[Pioneers of Liberty]], the first Jewish anarchist group in the U.S. The group was affiliated with the [[International Working People's Association]], the organization to which the Haymarket defendants had belonged, and they regarded the Haymarket men as martyrs. Since most of its members worked in the garment industry, the Pioneers of Liberty took part in [[Strike action|strikes]] against sweatshops and helped establish some of the first Jewish labor unions in the city. Before long, Berkman was one of the prominent members of the organization.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=19–20, 23–25}}\\n\\nAlthough he wasn't fluent in English, Berkman did speak German; he soon came under the influence of [[Johann Most]], the best known anarchist in the United States and an advocate of [[propaganda of the deed]]—''attentat'', or violence carried out to encourage the masses to revolt.{{Sfnm|1a1=Newell|1y=1977|1p=vi|2a1=Walter|2y=1989|2p=vii}} He became a typesetter for Most's German-language newspaper ''[[Freiheit (1879)|Freiheit]]''.{{Sfn|Pateman|2003|p=iii}}\\n\\nIn 1889, Berkman met and began a romance with [[Emma Goldman]], another Russian immigrant. He invited her to Most's lecture. Soon Berkman and Goldman fell in love and became inseparable. Despite their disagreements and separations, Goldman and Berkman would share a mutual devotion for decades, united by their anarchist principles and love for each other.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=30–33}}\\n\\nBy the end of the year, they moved into a communal apartment with Berkman's cousin, [[Modest Stein|Modest Aronstam]] (referred to as \"Fedya\" in both Berkman's ''[[Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist]]'' and Goldman's ''[[Living My Life]]''), and Goldman's friend, [[Helene Minkin]], along principles inspired by ''What Is to Be Done?'' Living according to the example of Rakhmetov, Berkman denied himself even the smallest pleasures, and expected his comrades to do the same. Aronstam, in contrast, occasionally brought home flowers. Frictions between the two grew: \"Every penny spent for ourselves was so much taken from the Cause,\" Berkman fumed. \"Luxury is a crime, a weakness.\" With time, however, the two cousins reconciled.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=33–35}}\\n\\nBerkman eventually broke with Most and aligned himself with the autonomists. The autonomists, an anarchist group associated with [[Josef Peukert]], emphasized individual freedom. They feared the domination of the anarchist movement by a single individual and opposed the establishment of anarchist organizations. Consequently, the autonomists were opposed to Most. Soon, Berkman was working for the autonomists' publications, ''{{ill|Der Anarchist|de}}'' and ''{{ill|Die Autonomie|de}}'', but he remained committed to the concept of violent action as a tool for inspiring revolutionary change.{{Sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1a2=Avrich|1y=2012|1pp=42–47|2a1=Wenzer|2y=1996|2p=35}}\\n\\nAt the end of 1891, Berkman learned that Russian anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]], whom he admired, had canceled an American speaking tour on the basis that it was too expensive for the struggling anarchist movement. While Berkman was disappointed, the frugality of the action further elevated Kropotkin's stature in his eyes.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=47–48}}\\n\\n===''Attentat'': Frick assassination attempt===\\n[[File:Berkman with Frick (1892).jpg|thumb|Berkman's attempt to assassinate Frick, as illustrated by W. P. Snyder for ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' in 1892|alt=Two men are sitting at a desk while a third man enters the office carrying a gun]]\\nIn 1892, Berkman, Goldman, and Aronstam relocated to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], where they operated a successful luncheonette. At the end of June, Goldman saw a newspaper headline that brought to her attention the trio's first opportunity for political action: the [[Homestead Strike]].{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=48–50, 57}} In June 1892, workers at a steel plant in [[Homestead, Pennsylvania]] were [[lockout (industry)|locked out]] when negotiations between the [[Carnegie Steel Company]] and the [[Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers]] failed. [[Henry Clay Frick]], the factory's notoriously anti-union manager, hired 300 armed guards from the [[Pinkerton Government Services|Pinkerton Detective Agency]] to break the union's [[picketing (protest)|picket lines]]. When the Pinkerton guards arrived at the factory on the morning of July&nbsp;6, a gunfight broke out. Nine union workers and seven guards were killed in the 12-hour fight.{{Sfn|Wexler|1984|pp=61–62}}\\n\\nNewspapers across the country defended the union workers, and the trio decided to assassinate Frick. They believed the assassination would arouse the [[working class]] to unite and revolt against the [[Capitalism|capitalist system]]. Berkman's plan was to assassinate Frick and then kill himself; Goldman was to explain Berkman's motives after his death; and Aronstam was to follow Berkman in the event that he failed in his mission. Emulating his Russian idols, Berkman tried to make a bomb, but when that failed, he went to [[Pittsburgh]] with the plan to use a handgun.{{Sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1a2=Avrich|1y=2012|1pp=57–61|2a1=Falk|2y=1990|2pp=24–25|3a1=Wexler|3y=1984|3pp=63–65}}\\n\\nArriving in Pittsburgh on July&nbsp;14, Berkman sought out anarchists Henry Bauer and Carl Nold. They were followers of Most, but supported the Homestead strike. Berkman had never met either man but counted on their support. Nold invited Berkman to stay with him, and he and Bauer introduced Berkman to several local anarchists.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=61–64}}\\n\\nBerkman was ready to carry out the assassination on July&nbsp;21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and in his pockets he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from ''What Is to Be Done?'' On July&nbsp;23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=65–67}}\\n\\nA carpenter who was working nearby heard the commotion and hit Berkman in the head with his hammer, but the blow only stunned him. The gunshots and struggle could be heard and seen from the street, and within minutes Frick's office had attracted all sorts of people, but Berkman continued to resist. A deputy sheriff aimed his gun at Berkman, but Frick said, \"Don't shoot. Leave him to the law.\" As the police led Berkman to the jail, an angry crowd gathered and shouted at Berkman. When he was questioned by police, Berkman said he had arrived in Pittsburgh on July&nbsp;21 and that he had acted alone. A dynamite capsule was discovered in his mouth after a policeman noticed that he was chewing on something.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=67–71}}\\n\\n[[File:Alexander Berkman 1.png|thumb|upright|Berkman's portrait, July&nbsp;24, 1892|alt=A 22-year-old man wearing an ill-fitting necktie, suit, and vest]]\\nOn July&nbsp;24, a police officer took Berkman for a portrait. He lent Berkman his own tie for the picture. The following day, Aronstam arrived in Pittsburgh with pockets full of dynamite to finish Berkman's botched assassination attempt. Somehow rumors of his arrival had preceded him, and he saw a newspaper headline that read \"Was Not Alone. Berkmann {{sic}} Had Accomplices in His Mission of Murder. Is Aaron Stamm Here?\" Aronstam became frightened, hid the dynamite in an outhouse, and returned to New York.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=72–73}}\\n\\nMost of the anarchists in Pittsburgh were questioned by police. Bauer and Nold were arrested and charged with complicity in Berkman's plot. Everywhere, anarchists took sides for or against Berkman and his ''attentat''. The autonomists supported him, as did many anarchists across the country. Peukert spoke out in his defense. Also defending Berkman was [[Dyer Lum]], an anarchist who had been a comrade of the Haymarket defendants, and [[Lucy Parsons]]. Among those who criticized Berkman were [[Jo Labadie]], [[Benjamin Tucker]], and many other anarchists who believed the anarchist struggle should be peaceful. Berkman's most prominent critic was Most, who belittled Berkman as a nuisance or a flunky hired by Frick himself to garner sympathy. Most published an article in his newspaper titled \"Reflections on ''Attentats''\" in which he wrote that propaganda of the deed was doomed to be misunderstood in the U.S. and that it could only backfire. Most wrote that Berkman's action had proven this; while Berkman might have demonstrated a certain heroism, in all other respects his attempt was a \"total failure\".{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=80–88}}\\n\\nBerkman was deeply interested in the debate concerning his action.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|p=91}} He was almost heartbroken by the rebuke from Most, who had \"preached propaganda by deed all his life—now he repudiates the first ''attentat'' in this country\".{{Sfn|Berkman|1970|p=107–108}} He was encouraged by the words of Kropotkin, who wrote that \"Berkman has done more to spread the anarchist idea among the masses who do not read our papers than all the writings that we may publish. He has shown that there are among the anarchists, men capable of being revolted by the crimes of capitalism to the point of giving their life to put an end to these crimes, or at least to open a way to such an end.\"{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|p=91}}\\n\\n===Trial===\\nBerkman declined the services of a lawyer for his trial. The warden cautioned him against this choice, but Berkman replied \"I don't believe in your laws. I don't acknowledge the authority of your courts. I am innocent morally\". Bauer and Nold visited him with their lawyers, who offered to represent him at no charge, but Berkman politely refused. As the trial approached, Berkman drafted a speech that he would read in court. Written in German because his English was still poor, it was 40&nbsp;pages long and took two hours to read. Berkman tried to learn the date of his trial, but it was kept secret by the district attorney out of fear of an attack by Berkman's comrades. Berkman therefore was unaware of his trial until the morning it began.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=91–92}}\\n\\nWhen Berkman was brought to the courtroom on September&nbsp;19, the jury had already been empaneled. The district attorney had selected the jury without allowing Berkman to examine prospective jurors, and the judge had no objection to the unusual procedure. Berkman was charged with six counts: felonious assault with the intent to kill Frick; felonious assault with the intent to kill Lawrence Leishman, who had been in Frick's office at the time of the attack; feloniously entering the offices of the Carnegie Steel Company on three occasions; and unlawfully carrying concealed weapons. Berkman pleaded not guilty to all charges.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=92–93}}\\n\\nFrick told the jury about the attempt on his life. The clothes he wore that day, bloody and riddled with holes, were shown to the jury. A physician testified that both of Berkman's weapons, the gun and the dagger, could have caused death. Leishman testified that Berkman fired his pistol at him once and Berkman asked, \"Well, did I intend to kill you?\" \"I think so\", Leishman replied, to which Berkman said, \"Well that's not true. I didn't intend to do it.\" Several witnesses told the jury that Berkman had visited the Carnegie offices three times. Berkman's dagger and gun were placed into evidence, and the prosecution rested.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=93–94}}\\n\\nBerkman was asked to call his witnesses, but he had none. Instead, he asked to read his statement to the jury. A German translator was brought to the court. As an atheist, Berkman refused to be sworn in. He began reading his prepared statement. When the translator began to speak on his behalf to the jury, Berkman discovered the man was incompetent. He felt the man's voice was \"cracked and shrill\" as he spoke to the jury in broken English himself. The effect of the statement, Berkman thought, was being lost. After about an hour, the judge told Berkman it was time to finish his oration.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|p=94}}\\n\\nWithout leaving the jury box, the jurors found Berkman guilty on all charges. The judge gave Berkman the maximum sentence for each count: a total of 21&nbsp;years in prison and one year in the [[Penal labour|workhouse]], to be served consecutively. Berkman argued that he should be sentenced only for the attempt on Frick's life and that the other charges were elements of the main crime of assault with the intent to kill, but the judge overruled his objection. In four hours, Berkman had been tried, convicted, and sentenced. He was brought to serve his sentence at Pennsylvania's [[State Correctional Institution – Pittsburgh|Western Penitentiary]].{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=95–96}}\\n\\n===Prison===\\nWithin weeks of his arrival at prison, Berkman began planning his suicide. He tried to sharpen a spoon into a blade, but his attempt was discovered by a guard and Berkman spent the night in the dungeon. He thought about beating his head against the bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, asking her to secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew as soon as he saw Goldman that she had not brought the dynamite capsule.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=98–100}}\\n\\nBetween 1893 and 1897, the years when Bauer and Nold were also in the Western Penitentiary for their part in the assassination attempt, the three men surreptitiously produced 60 issues of a hand-written anarchist newsletter by transferring their work from cell to cell. They managed to send the completed newsletters, which they called ''Prison Blossoms'', to friends outside the prison.{{Sfn|Brody|2011|p=xvi}} Participating in ''Prison Blossoms'', initially written in German and later in English, helped Berkman improve his English. He developed a friendship with the prison chaplain, John Lynn Milligan, who was a strong advocate on behalf of the prison library. Milligan encouraged Berkman to read books from the library, a process that furthered his knowledge of English.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=103–104}}\\n\\nBerkman frequently clashed with the prison's management over the mistreatment of his fellow prisoners. Sometimes he was put into solitary confinement, with one stay lasting 16 months. When Berkman smuggled reports of corruption and brutality outside the prison, resulting in an investigation, he was taken to the dungeon and put in a straitjacket.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=106–108}}\\n\\nLetters from friends were like lifelines to Berkman. \"The very arrival of a letter is momentous,\" he wrote. \"It brings a glow into the prisoner's heart to feel that he is remembered.\"{{Sfn|Berkman|1970|p=310}} Goldman and anarchist [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] were regular correspondents, and other friends wrote frequently.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|p=109}}\\n\\nIn 1897, as Berkman finished the fifth year of his sentence, he applied to the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons. Having served as his own attorney, Berkman had failed to object to the trial judge's rulings and thus had no legal basis for an appeal; a pardon was his only hope for early release. The Board of Pardons denied his application in October 1897. A second application was rejected in early 1899.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=124–127}}\\n\\nNow an escape seemed like Berkman's only option. The plan was to rent a house across the street from the prison and dig a tunnel from the house to the prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=127–129}}\\n\\nDigging the tunnel turned out to be more difficult than expected. The soil was rocky, which forced the men to dig deeper than planned. There, they discovered a leaking gas main, which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the digging, one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July&nbsp;5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified to discover that the entrance was blocked by a large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=129–131}}\\n\\nThree weeks later, some children playing in the street wandered into the yard of the now-vacant house. One of them fell into the cellar and discovered the tunnel. While the prison's Board of Inspectors was unable to identify the inmate involved in the escape attempt, the warden punished Berkman by sending him to solitary confinement for nearly a year. Days after he was released from solitary, Berkman tried to hang himself with a strip of his blanket.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=131–133}}\\n\\nSoon things began looking up for Berkman. He received word that his sentence had been reduced by two-and-a-half years, thanks to a new law. He also received his first visitor in nine years. A month later, Goldman was able to visit under an assumed name. The warden retired and his successor improved the prison for all prisoners.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=133–134}}\\n\\nEarly in his incarceration, Berkman questioned whether two men could love one another.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|p=105}} He was aware, as he later wrote, that incidents of rape or attempted rape took place \"almost every week, yet no one has ever been taken to court ... on such charges\".{{Sfn|Berkman|1970|p=335}} Some of Berkman's own friendships within the prison became physical. He became intimate with one prisoner, \"Johnny\", when the two were confined to the dungeon. He discussed homosexuality with another prisoner, \"George\", a formerly married physician who told Berkman about his own homosexual prison affair.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=105–106}}\\n\\nIn 1905, Berkman was transported from the Western Penitentiary to the [[Allegheny County Workhouse]], where he spent the final 10 months of his sentence.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|p=181}} He found conditions in the workhouse \"a nightmare of cruelty, infinitely worse than the most inhuman aspects of the penitentiary.\"{{Sfn|Berkman|1970|p=492}} The guards beat inmates at the slightest provocation, and one particularly sadistic guard shoved prisoners down the stairs. Berkman felt mixed emotions; while he was excited about the prospect of freedom, he was concerned about the friends he had made in the prison, and he was worried about what his life as a free man would be like.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=181–182}}\\n\\n===Release===\\nBerkman was released from the workhouse on May&nbsp;18, 1906, after serving 14&nbsp;years of his sentence. He was met at the workhouse gates by newspaper reporters and police, who recommended that he leave the area. He took the train to [[Detroit]], where Goldman met him.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=183–184}} She found herself \"seized by terror and pity\" at his gaunt appearance.{{Sfn|Goldman|1970|p=383–384}} Later, at a friend's house, Berkman felt overwhelmed by the presence of well-wishers. He became [[Claustrophobia|claustrophobic]] and almost suicidal. Nevertheless, he agreed to a joint lecture tour with Goldman.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=184–185}}\\n\\nBack in New York after the tour, Berkman and Goldman tried to rekindle their romantic relationship, but had lost passion for each other. Instead, Berkman was attracted to some of the younger women in the movement, including a teenager named [[Becky Edelsohn]].{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=189–190}}\\n\\nBerkman continued to suffer from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and increasingly spoke about committing suicide. He began a new lecture tour, but when he failed to appear in [[Cleveland]], concerned friends sent a telegram to Goldman in New York. She worried that he had killed himself. Anarchists across the country searched for Berkman in police stations, hospitals, and morgues. Even newspapers wondered where he was, speculating that he had been kidnapped by Pittsburgh detectives, by [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents, or by \"agents of millionaires\" who opposed his message. Three days later, Berkman appeared in New York and contacted Goldman. He said the lecture tour had made him feel miserable. He had purchased a handgun in Cleveland with the intention of killing himself in a city where nobody knew him, but he was unable to complete the act.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|p=191}}\\n\\n[[File:Mother Earth 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Berkman edited ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]'' from 1907 to 1915.|alt=A magazine cover with the caption \"Patriotism in Action\" shows a fat capitalist using a flagpole with the American flag to stab an emaciated worker]]\\nAfter resting for several months, Berkman began to recover. He remained anxious about his lack of employment. He considered returning to his old job as a printer, but his skills had become obsolete in light of innovations in [[linotype machine]]s. With Goldman's encouragement, Berkman began to write an account of his prison years, ''[[Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist]]'', and she invited him to become the editor of her journal, ''[[Mother Earth (magazine)|Mother Earth]]''.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=191–192}} He served as editor from 1907 to 1915 and took the journal in a more provocative and practical direction, in contrast to the more theoretical approach which had been favored by the previous editor, [[Max Baginski]].{{Sfn|Glassgold|2001|p=xxii}} Under Berkman's stewardship, circulation of ''Mother Earth'' rose to as high as 10,000{{Sfn|Glassgold|2001|p=xxii}} and it became the leading anarchist publication in the U.S. at the time.{{Sfn|Avrich|1988|p=203}}\\n\\n===Ferrer Center===\\nBerkman helped establish the [[Modern School (United States)|Ferrer Center]] in New York during 1910 and 1911 and served as one of its teachers.

On April&nbsp;20, 1914, the [[Colorado National Guard]] fought a tent colony of striking miners and, during the day-long fight, 26 people were killed.{{Sfn|Zinn|2003|pp=354–355}}\\n\\nDuring the strike, Berkman organized demonstrations in New York in support of the miners. In May and June, he and other anarchists led several protests against [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] The protests eventually moved from New York City to Rockefeller's home in [[Tarrytown, New York]], and resulted in beatings, arrests, and imprisonments of anarchists. The strong police response to the Tarrytown protests led to a bomb plot by several Ferrer Center anarchists.{{Sfn|Avrich|2006|pp=213–215}}\\n\\n[[File:Alexander Berkman speaking in Union Square 1.png|left|thumb|upright=1.25|Berkman addressing a [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] rally in New York's [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], 1914|alt=A large crowd of people, some carrying banners.

Fifteen minutes later a deadly explosion took place.

Although it was published for just 18 months, ''The Blast'' was considered second only to ''Mother Earth'' in its influence among U.S. anarchists.{{Sfn|Avrich|1988|pp=203–204}}\\n\\nOn July&nbsp;22, 1916, [[Preparedness Day Bombing|a bomb exploded]] during the San Francisco Preparedness Day Parade, killing ten people and wounding 40. Police suspected Berkman, although there was no evidence, and ultimately their investigation focused on two local labor activists, [[Thomas Mooney]] and [[Warren Billings]]. Although neither Mooney nor Billings were anarchists, Berkman came to their aid: raising a defense fund, hiring lawyers, and beginning a national campaign on their behalf. Mooney and Billings were convicted, with Mooney sentenced to death and Billings to life imprisonment.{{Sfn|Avrich|1988|p=204}}\\n\\nBerkman arranged for Russian anarchists to protest outside the American embassy in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] during the [[Russian Revolution]], which led U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to ask California's governor to commute Mooney's death sentence. When the governor reluctantly did so, he said that \"the propaganda in [Mooney's] behalf following the plan outlined by Berkman has been so effective as to become world-wide.\"{{Sfn|Wenzer|1996|pp=59–60}} Billings and Mooney both were pardoned in 1939.\\n\\n===World War I===\\nIn 1917 the U.S. entered [[World War I]] and Congress enacted the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], which required all men between the ages of 21 and 30 to register for military [[conscription]]. Berkman moved back to New York, where he and Goldman organized the [[No Conscription League]] of New York, which proclaimed: \"We oppose conscription because we are internationalists, anti-militarists, and opposed to all wars waged by capitalistic governments.\"{{Sfn|Berkman|1992|p=155}} The organization was at the forefront of anti-draft activism, and chapters were established in other cities. The No Conscription League changed its focus from public meetings to disseminating pamphlets after police started disrupting the group's public events in search of young men who had not registered for the draft.{{Sfn|Drinnon|1961|pp=186–187}}\\n\\nBerkman and Goldman were arrested during a raid of their offices on June&nbsp;15, 1917, during which police seized what ''The New York Times'' described as \"a wagon load of anarchist records and propaganda material\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Emma Goldman and A.

Berkman invoked the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], asking how the government could claim to fight for \"liberty and democracy\" in Europe while suppressing free speech at home:\\n\\n<blockquote>Will you proclaim to the world that you who carry liberty and democracy to Europe have no liberty here, that you who are fighting for democracy in Germany, suppress democracy right here in New York, in the United States? Are you going to suppress free speech and liberty in this country, and still pretend that you love liberty so much that you will fight for it five thousand miles away?{{Sfn|Berkman|Goldman|1917|p=55}}</blockquote>\\n\\nThe jury found them guilty and Judge [[Julius Marshuetz Mayer|Julius M. Mayer]] imposed the maximum sentence: two years' imprisonment, a $10,000 fine, and the possibility of deportation after their release from prison.{{Sfn|Wexler|1984|p=235}} Berkman served his sentence in the [[United States Penitentiary, Atlanta|Atlanta Federal Penitentiary]], seven months of which he spent in solitary confinement for protesting the beating of other inmates.{{Sfn|Avrich|1988|p=204}} When he was released on October&nbsp;1, 1919, Berkman looked \"haggard and pale\"; according to Goldman, the 21 months Berkman served in Atlanta took a greater toll on him than his 14-year incarceration in Pennsylvania.{{Sfn|Goldman|1970|p=698}}\\n\\n===Russia===\\nBerkman and Goldman were released at the height of the [[First Red Scare|first U.S. Red Scare]]; the [[Russian Revolution|Russian Revolutions of 1917]], combined with anxiety about the war, produced a climate of anti-radical and anti-foreign sentiment. The U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s General Intelligence Division, headed by [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and under the direction of Attorney General [[Alexander Mitchell Palmer]], initiated a [[Palmer raids|series of raids]] to arrest leftists.{{Sfn|Falk|1990|pp=176–177}} While they were in prison, Hoover wrote: \"Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman are, beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists in this country and if permitted to return to the community will result in undue harm.\"{{Sfn|Falk|1990|pp=177–178}} Under the 1918 [[Anarchist Exclusion Act]], the government deported Berkman, who had never applied for U.S. citizenship, along with Goldman and more than two hundred others, to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] aboard the [[USAT Buford|''Buford'']].{{Sfn|Wexler|1984|pp=266–274}}\\n\\n[[File:Alexander Berkman 2.png|left|thumb|Berkman in 1919, on the eve of his deportation|alt=A 49-year-old man with a balding head wearing a pair of glasses]]\\nAt a farewell banquet in Chicago, Berkman and Goldman were told the news of the death of Henry Clay Frick, whom Berkman had tried to kill more than 25 years earlier. Asked for a comment by a reporter, Berkman said Frick had been \"deported by God\".{{Sfn|Goldman|1970|p=709}}\\n\\nBerkman's initial reaction to the Bolshevik revolution was enthusiastic. When he first heard of their coup, he exclaimed \"this is the happiest moment of my life\", and he wrote that the Bolsheviks were the \"expression of the most fundamental longing of the human soul\".{{Sfn|Wenzer|1996|p=72}} Arrival in Russia stirred great emotions in Berkman, and he described it as \"the most sublime day in my life\", surpassing even his release after 14 years in prison.{{Sfn|Berkman|1989|p=28}}\\n\\nBerkman and Goldman spent much of 1920 traveling through Russia collecting material for a proposed Museum of the Revolution. As the pair traveled around the country, they found repression, mismanagement, and corruption instead of the equality and worker empowerment they had dreamed of. Those who questioned the government were demonized as [[counter-revolutionary|counter-revolutionaries]], and workers still labored under severe conditions.{{Sfn|Wenzer|1996|pp=92–93}} They met with [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], who assured them that government suppression of press liberties was justified. \"When the Revolution is out of danger,\" he told them, \"then free speech might be indulged in\".{{Sfn|Berkman|1989|p=91}}\\n\\nStrikes broke out in [[Petrograd]] in March 1921 when workers demonstrated for better food rations and more autonomy for their unions. Berkman and Goldman supported the strikers, writing: \"To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal.\"{{Sfn|Wenzer|1996|p=99}} The unrest spread to the port of [[Kronstadt]], where [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] ordered a military response. In the [[Kronstadt rebellion|battle that ensued]], 600 sailors were killed; 2,000 more were arrested; and 500 to 1,500 Soviet troops died. In the wake of these events, Berkman and Goldman decided there was no future in the country for them. Berkman wrote in his diary:\\n\\n[[File:Bolshevik Myth.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Berkman's experiences in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]] were the basis of ''[[The Bolshevik Myth]]'' (1925).|alt=The title page of Berkman's book, The Bolshevik Myth]]<blockquote>Gray are the passing days. One by one the embers of hope have died out. Terror and despotism have crushed the life born in October. ... Dictatorship is trampling the masses under foot. The Revolution is dead; its spirit cries in the wilderness. ... I have decided to leave Russia.{{Sfn|Berkman|1989|p=319}}</blockquote>Berkman and Goldman left the country in December 1921. Berkman moved to [[Berlin]] and almost immediately began to write a series of pamphlets about the Russian Revolution. \"The Russian Tragedy\", \"The Russian Revolution and the Communist Party\", and \"The Kronstadt Rebellion\" were published during the summer of 1922.{{Sfn|Walter|1989|p=xii}}\\n\\nBerkman planned to write a book about his experience in Russia, but he postponed it while he assisted Goldman as she wrote a similar book, using as sources material he had collected. Work on Goldman's book, ''My Two Years in Russia'', was completed in December 1922, and the book was published in two parts with titles not of her choosing: ''[[My Disillusionment in Russia]]'' (1923) and ''[[My Further Disillusionment in Russia]]'' (1924). Berkman worked on his book, ''[[The Bolshevik Myth]]'', throughout 1923 and it was published in January 1925.{{Sfn|Walter|1989|pp=xiii–xiv}}\\n\\n=== ''Now and After'' ===\\n[[File:Makhno Berkman.jpg|thumb|right|''Berkman (right) and [[Nestor Makhno]] in Paris, 1927''|alt=Two middle-aged man pose for an informal photo under some trees.

He organized a fund for aging anarchists including [[Sébastien Faure]], [[Errico Malatesta]], and [[Max Nettlau]]. He continued to fight on behalf of anarchist prisoners in the Soviet Union, and arranged the publication of ''[[Letters from Russian Prisons]]'', which detailed their persecution.{{Sfn|Avrich|1988|pp=205–206}}\\n\\nIn 1926, the Jewish Anarchist Federation of New York asked Berkman to write an introduction to anarchism intended for the general public. By presenting the principles of anarchism in plain language, the New York anarchists hoped that readers might be swayed to support the movement or, at a minimum, that the book might improve the image of anarchism and anarchists in the public's eyes. Berkman produced ''[[Now and After|Now and After: The ABC of Communist Anarchism]]'', first published in 1929 and reprinted many times since (often under the title ''What Is Communist Anarchism?'' or ''What Is Anarchism?'').{{Sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1988|1p=206|2a1=Pateman|2y=2003|2p=viii}} Anarchist [[Stuart Christie]] wrote that ''Now and After'' is \"among the best introductions to the ideas of anarchism in the English language\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P2-1952734/books-building-a-library-anarchy |title=Building a Library: Anarchy |last=Christie |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart Christie |date=July 24, 2005 |work=The Independent |access-date=January 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607040639/http://www.questia.com/read/1P2-1952734/books-building-a-library-anarchy |archive-date=June 7, 2013 |url-status=dead  }} {{subscription required}}</ref> and historian [[Paul Avrich]] described it as \"the clearest exposition of communist anarchism in English or any other language\".{{Sfn|Avrich|1988|p=206}}\\n\\n===Final years and death===\\nBerkman spent his last years eking out a precarious living as an editor and translator. He and his companion, Emmy Eckstein, relocated frequently within [[Nice]] in search of smaller and less expensive quarters. Aronstam, who had changed his name to [[Modest Stein]] and attained success as an artist, became a benefactor, sending Berkman a monthly sum to help with expenses.{{Sfn|Avrich|Avrich|2012|pp=362–364, 373}} In the 1930s his health began to deteriorate, and he underwent two unsuccessful operations for a [[prostate]] condition in early 1936. After the second surgery, he was bed-ridden for months. In constant pain, forced to rely on the financial help of friends and dependent on Eckstein's care, Berkman decided to commit [[suicide]]. In the early hours of June&nbsp;28, 1936, unable to endure the physical pain of his ailment, Berkman tried to shoot himself in the heart with a handgun, but he failed to make a clean job of it. The bullet punctured a lung and his stomach and lodged in his spinal column, paralyzing him. Goldman rushed to Nice to be at his side. Berkman recognized her but was unable to speak. He sank into a coma in the afternoon, and died at 10&nbsp;o'clock that night.{{Sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1988|1pp=206–207|2a1=Avrich|2a2=Avrich|2y=2012|2pp=??|3a1=Wexler|3y=1989|3pp=193–194}}\\n\\nGoldman made funeral arrangements for Berkman.

Born into a wealthy Jewish family in Vilnius, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1888 and became involved in the anarchist movement. Berkman's failed assassination attempt on Henry Clay Frick during the Homestead strike led to 14 years in prison, which he detailed in his book \"Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist.\" After his release, he edited journals like \"Mother Earth\" and \"The Blast,\" and was deported to Russia with Emma Goldman following their opposition to the U.S. draft. Disillusioned by the Bolsheviks' repression, they left Russia in 1921. Berkman continued his anarchist work in France, authoring \"Now and After: The ABC of Communist Anarchism\" before taking his own life in 1936 due to poor health.\n",

In 2006, Namco merged with [[Bandai]] to form what is now named [[Bandai Namco Holdings]]; the standalone Namco brand continues to be used for video arcade and other entertainment products by the group's Bandai Namco Amusements division.\\n\\nThe ''Namco'' name comes from ''Nakamura Manufacturing Company'', derived from its founder [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]]. In the 1960s, it manufactured [[Electro-mechanical game|electro-mechanical]] [[arcade games]] such as the 1965 hit ''[[Periscope (arcade game)|Periscope]]''. It entered the [[video game industry]] after acquiring the struggling Japanese division of [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] in 1974, distributing games such as ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'' in Japan. The company renamed itself Namco in 1977 and published ''[[Gee Bee (video game)|Gee Bee]]'', its first original video game, a year later. Among Namco's first major hits was the fixed shooter ''[[Galaxian]]'' in 1979. It was followed by ''[[Pac-Man]]'' in 1980. Namco prospered during the [[golden age of arcade video games]] in the early 1980s, releasing popular titles such as ''[[Galaga]]'', ''[[Xevious]]'', and ''[[Pole Position]]''.\\n\\nNamco entered the home market in 1984 with conversions of its arcade games for the [[MSX]] and the [[Nintendo]] [[Family Computer]], later expanding to competing platforms, such as the [[Sega Genesis]], [[TurboGrafx-16]], and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. Namco continued to produce hit games in the 1990s, including ''[[Ridge Racer (1993 video game)|Ridge Racer]]'', ''[[Tekken (video game)|Tekken]]'', and ''[[Taiko no Tatsujin]]'', but later endured financial difficulties due to the struggling Japanese economy and diminishing arcade market. This led to the 2005 announcement of a merge with toy maker [[Bandai]], which was completed in 2006 as [[Namco Bandai Holdings]]; Namco's former video games division was merged into a subsidiary of the holdings company, Namco Bandai Games, now called [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]]. Namco is remembered in retrospect for its unique corporate model, its importance to the industry, and its advancements in technology.\\n\\n==History==\\n===Origins and acquisition of Atari Japan (1955–1977)===\\n[[File:Nakamura Seisakusho Co. logo.svg|thumb|The logo of Nakamura Seisakusho, the predecessor to Namco|alt=Nakamura Seisakusho logo]]\\nOn June 1, 1955, Japanese businessman [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] founded {{nihongo foot|'''Nakamura Seisakusho Co., Ltd.''',|株式会社中村製作所|Kabushiki gaisha Nakamura Seisakujo|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Ikegami, Tokyo.<ref name=\"JTimes\">{{cite web |last1=Kikuchi |first1=Daisuke |title='Father of Pac-Man,' Masaya Nakamura, dies at age 91 |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/01/30/national/father-pac-man-masaya-nakamura-dies-age-91/ |website=[[The Japan Times]] |access-date=August 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108023907/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/01/30/national/father-pac-man-masaya-nakamura-dies-age-91/ |archive-date=November 8, 2017 |date=January 30, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"BNE History\">{{cite web |title=Corporate History |url=https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/corporate/history/namco/index.html |website=[[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] |access-date=August 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181210202633/https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/corporate/history/namco/index.html |archive-date=December 10, 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> The son of a shotgun repair business owner, Nakamura proved unable to find work in his chosen profession of ship building in the struggling post-[[World War II]] economy.

touring in support of the band's previous album, ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005), the album was recorded in late 2006. It was produced by [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Atticus Ross]], and was the band's first studio album since 1994's ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' that was not co-produced by long-time collaborator [[Alan Moulder]]. It was the band's last album for Interscope, following Reznor's departure the same year due to a dispute regarding overseas pricing.\\n\\nIn contrast to the introspective style of songwriting featured on the band's previous work, the record is a [[concept album]] that criticizes contemporary policies of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] by presenting a [[dystopia]]n vision of the year 2022. It was part of a larger Year Zero project, which included a [[Year Zero Remixed|remix album]], an [[Year Zero (game)|alternate reality game of the same name]], as well as a conceived television or film adaptation. The game expanded upon the album's storyline, using websites, pre-recorded phone messages, murals, among other media in promotion of the project. The album was promoted by two singles: \"[[Survivalism (song)|Survivalism]]\" and \"[[Capital G]]\".\\n\\n''Year Zero'' received positive reviews from critics, who complimented its concept and production, as well as the accompanying alternate reality game. The album reached number 2 in the United States, number 6 in the United Kingdom, and the top 10 in some other countries.\\n\\n==Recording==\\n{{Quote box|quote=\"This record began as an experiment with noise on a laptop in a bus on tour somewhere.

Produced by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, it was the band's first album since 1994 without long-time collaborator Alan Moulder and marked Reznor's departure from Interscope. Unlike previous albums, \"Year Zero\" is a concept album critiquing U.S. government policies through a dystopian vision of 2022. The album was part of a larger project including a remix album and an alternate reality game. Promoted by singles \"Survivalism\" and \"Capital G,\" it received positive critical reception and charted highly in multiple countries. The recording process began as an experimental noise project during a tour, evolving into a narrative set in a politically, spiritually, and environmentally dire future.\n",

It is extremely [[radioactive]]: its most stable known [[isotope]], nihonium-286, has a [[half-life]] of about 10 seconds. In the [[periodic table]], nihonium is a [[transactinide element]] in the [[p-block]]. It is a member of [[period 7 element|period 7]] and [[boron group|group 13]].\\n\\nNihonium was first reported to have been created in experiments carried out between 14 July and 10 August 2003, by a Russian–American collaboration at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], Russia, working in collaboration with the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[Livermore, California]], and on 23 July 2004, by a team of Japanese scientists at [[Riken]] in [[Wakō, Saitama|Wakō]], Japan. The confirmation of their claims in the ensuing years involved independent teams of scientists working in the [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], and [[China]], as well as the original claimants in Russia and Japan. In 2015, the [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party]] recognised the element and assigned the [[scientific priority|priority]] of the discovery and naming rights for the element to Riken. The Riken team suggested the name ''nihonium'' in 2016, which was approved in the same year. The name comes from the common Japanese name for {{nihongo|Japan|日本|[[Names of Japan#Nihon and Nippon|nihon]]}}.\\n\\nVery little is known about nihonium, as it has been made only in very small amounts that decay within seconds. The anomalously long lives of some superheavy nuclides, including some nihonium isotopes, are explained by the [[island of stability]] theory. Experiments to date have supported the theory, with the half-lives of the confirmed nihonium isotopes increasing from milliseconds to seconds as [[neutron]]s are added and the island is approached. Nihonium has been calculated to have similar properties to its homologues [[boron]], [[aluminium]], [[gallium]], [[indium]], and [[thallium]]. All but boron are [[post-transition metal]]s, and nihonium is expected to be a post-transition metal as well. It should also show several major differences from them; for example, nihonium should be more stable in the +1 [[oxidation state]] than the +3 state, like thallium, but in the +1 state nihonium should behave more like [[silver]] and [[astatine]] than thallium. Preliminary experiments have shown that elemental nihonium is not very [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]], and that it is less reactive than its lighter homologue thallium.\\n\\n==Introduction==\\n{{Excerpt|Superheavy element|Introduction|subsections=yes}}\\n\\n== History ==\\n{{See also|Discoveries of the chemical elements}}\\n\\n=== Early indications ===\\nThe syntheses of elements [[bohrium|107]] to [[copernicium|112]] were conducted at the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] in [[Darmstadt]], Germany, from 1981 to 1996.

These fusion reactions can be divided into \"hot\" and \"cold\" fusion, depending on the excitation energy of the compound nucleus produced. \"Cold fusion\" in the context of superheavy element synthesis is a distinct concept from the idea that nuclear fusion can be achieved under room temperature conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-0728(89)80006-3 |title=Electrochemically induced nuclear fusion of deuterium |date=1989 |last1=Fleischmann |first1=Martin |last2=Pons |first2=Stanley |journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry and Interfacial Electrochemistry |volume=261 |issue=2 |pages=301–308}}</ref> In hot fusion reactions, light, high-energy projectiles are accelerated towards heavy targets ([[actinide]]s), creating compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40–50&nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]]) that may fission, or alternatively emit several (3 to 5) neutrons.<ref name=\"fusion\">{{cite journal |last1=Barber |first1=Robert C. |last2=Gäggeler |first2=Heinz W. |last3=Karol |first3=Paul J. |last4=Nakahara |first4=Hiromichi |last5=Vardaci |first5=Emanuele |last6=Vogt |first6=Erich |title=Discovery of the element with atomic number 112 (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry |volume=81 |issue=7 |page=1331 |date=2009 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-08-03-05|doi-access=free }}</ref> Cold fusion reactions use heavier projectiles, typically from the [[period 4 element|fourth period]], and lighter targets, usually [[lead]] and [[bismuth]]. The fused nuclei produced have a relatively low excitation energy (~10–20&nbsp;MeV), which decreases the probability that they will undergo fission reactions. As the fused nuclei cool to the [[ground state]], they emit only one or two neutrons. Hot fusion produces more neutron-rich products because actinides have the highest neutron-to-proton ratios of any elements, and is currently the only method to produce the superheavy elements from [[flerovium]] (element 114) onwards.<ref name=\"AM89\">{{Cite journal |first1=Peter |last1=Armbruster |first2=Gottfried |last2=Munzenberg |title=Creating superheavy elements |journal=Scientific American |volume=34 |pages=36–42 |date=1989}}</ref>}} reactions, in which targets made of [[lead]] and [[bismuth]], which are around the [[nuclear shell model|stable configuration]] of 82 protons, are bombarded with heavy ions of [[period 4 element]]s. This creates fused nuclei with low excitation energies due to the stability of the targets' nuclei, significantly increasing the yield of [[superheavy element]]s. Cold fusion was pioneered by [[Yuri Oganessian]] and his team in 1974 at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] (JINR) in [[Dubna]], Soviet Union. Yields from cold fusion reactions were found to decrease significantly with increasing atomic number; the resulting nuclei were severely neutron-deficient and short-lived.

[[Calcium-48]] was suggested as an ideal projectile, because it is very neutron-rich for a light element (combined with the already neutron-rich actinides) and would minimise the neutron deficiencies of the nuclides produced. Being [[doubly magic]], it would confer benefits in stability to the fused nuclei.

According to the JWP criteria, a discovery must demonstrate that the element has an atomic number different from all previously observed values. It should also preferably be repeated by other laboratories, although this requirement has been waived where the data is of very high quality. Such a demonstration must establish properties, either physical or chemical, of the new element and establish that they are those of a previously unknown element. The main techniques used to demonstrate atomic number are cross-reactions (creating claimed [[Nuclide|nuclides]] as parents or daughters of other nuclides produced by a different reaction) and anchoring decay chains to known daughter nuclides. For the JWP, priority in confirmation takes precedence over the date of the original claim. Both teams set out to confirm their results by these methods.<ref name=\"Karol\" />\\n[[File:Element 113 decay chains.svg|thumb|upright=3|center|Summary of decay chains passing through isotopes of element 113, ending at [[mendelevium]] (element 101) or earlier.

The aim of this experiment had been to synthesise the isotopes <sup>281</sup>113 and <sup>282</sup>113 that would fill in the gap between isotopes produced via hot fusion (<sup>283</sup>113 and <sup>284</sup>113) and cold fusion (<sup>278</sup>113). After five alpha decays, these nuclides would reach known isotopes of [[lawrencium]], assuming that the decay chains were not terminated prematurely by spontaneous fission. The first decay chain ended in fission after four alpha decays, presumably originating from <sup>266</sup>Db or its electron-capture daughter <sup>266</sup>Rf. [[Spontaneous fission]] was not observed in the second chain even after four alpha decays. A fifth alpha decay in each chain could have been missed, since <sup>266</sup>Db can theoretically undergo alpha decay, in which case the first decay chain would have ended at the known <sup>262</sup>Lr or <sup>262</sup>No and the second might have continued to the known long-lived <sup>258</sup>Md, which has a half-life of 51.5&nbsp;days, longer than the duration of the experiment: this would explain the lack of a spontaneous fission event in this chain. In the absence of direct detection of the long-lived [[Alpha decay|alpha decays]], these interpretations remain unconfirmed, and there is still no known link between any superheavy nuclides produced by hot fusion and the well-known main body of the chart of nuclides.<ref name=\"07Og01\">{{cite journal |url=http://nrv.jinr.ru/pdf_file/PhysRevC_76_011601.pdf |title=Synthesis of the isotope <sup>282</sup>113 in the <sup>237</sup>Np + <sup>48</sup>Ca fusion reaction |last1=Oganessian |first1=Yu.

The JWP recognised the discovery of element 113, assigning priority to Riken. They noted that while the individual decay energies of each nuclide in the decay chain of <sup>278</sup>113 were inconsistent, their sum was now confirmed to be consistent, strongly suggesting that the initial and final states in <sup>278</sup>113 and its daughter <sup>262</sup>Db were the same for all three events. The decay of <sup>262</sup>Db to <sup>258</sup>Lr and <sup>254</sup>Md was previously known, firmly anchoring the decay chain of <sup>278</sup>113 to known regions of the chart of nuclides. The JWP considered that the JINR–LLNL collaborations of 2004 and 2007, producing element 113 as the daughter of element 115, did not meet the discovery criteria as they had not convincingly determined the atomic numbers of their nuclides through cross-bombardments, which were considered necessary since their decay chains were not anchored to previously known nuclides. They also considered that the previous JWP's concerns over their chemical identification of the dubnium daughter had not been adequately addressed. The JWP recognised the JINR–LLNL–ORNL–Vanderbilt collaboration of 2010 as having discovered elements 117 and 115, and accepted that element 113 had been produced as their daughter, but did not give this work shared credit.<ref name=\"Karol\">{{cite journal |last1=Karol |first1=Paul J. |last2=Barber |first2=Robert C. |last3=Sherrill |first3=Bradley M. |last4=Vardaci |first4=Emanuele |last5=Yamazaki |first5=Toshimitsu |date=22 December 2015 |title=Discovery of the elements with atomic numbers Z = 113, 115 and 117 (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=Pure Appl.

If this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters becomes a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have different half-lives: for example, the ground state of <sup>180</sup>Ta has a half-life of hours, but an excited state [[isotopes of tantalum|<sup>180m</sup>Ta]] has never been observed to decay.

All isotopes with an atomic number above [[mendelevium|101]] undergo radioactive decay with half-lives of less than 30 hours: this is because of the ever-increasing [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb repulsion]] of protons, so that the [[strong nuclear force]] cannot hold the nucleus together against [[spontaneous fission]] for long. Calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilising factors, elements with more than [[lawrencium|103 protons]] should not exist. Researchers in the 1960s suggested that the closed [[nuclear shell model|nuclear shells]] around 114 protons and 184 neutrons should counteract this instability, and create an \"[[island of stability]]\" containing nuclides with half-lives reaching thousands or millions of years. The existence of the island is still unproven, but the existence of the [[superheavy element]]s (including nihonium) confirms that the stabilising effect is real, and in general the known superheavy nuclides become longer-lived as they approach the predicted location of the island.<ref>{{cite book |title=Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia |first1=Douglas M. |last1=Considine |first2=Glenn D. |last2=Considine |publisher=Wiley-Interscience |date=1994 |edition=8th |isbn=978-1-4757-6918-0 |page=623}}</ref><ref name=\"retro\" />\\n\\nAll nihonium isotopes are unstable and radioactive; the heavier nihonium isotopes are more stable than the lighter ones, as they are closer to the centre of the island.

The former results from the involvement of only the single p electron in bonding, and the latter results in the involvement of all three valence electrons, two in the s-subshell and one in the p-subshell. Going down the group, bond energies decrease and the +3 state becomes less stable, as the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the s-electrons. Hence, for aluminium and gallium +3 is the most stable state, but +1 gains importance for indium and by thallium it becomes more stable than the +3 state. Nihonium is expected to continue this trend and have +1 as its most stable oxidation state.<ref name=\"Haire\" />\\n\\nThe simplest possible nihonium compound is the monohydride, NhH. The bonding is provided by the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electron of nihonium and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The SO interaction causes the [[binding energy]] of nihonium monohydride to be reduced by about 1&nbsp;eV<ref name=\"Haire\" /> and the nihonium–hydrogen bond length to decrease as the bonding 7p<sub>1/2</sub> orbital is relativistically contracted.

It is highly radioactive, with its most stable isotope, nihonium-286, having a half-life of about 10 seconds. Discovered through collaborations between Russian, American, and Japanese scientists in 2003 and 2004, its existence was confirmed by multiple international teams. In 2015, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party recognized the element and attributed the discovery to the Riken institute in Japan, which proposed the name \"nihonium.\" This name is derived from \"Nihon,\" the Japanese word for Japan. Little is known about nihonium due to its short-lived nature, but it is theorized to exhibit properties similar to those of other group 13 elements like boron and aluminium, though with unique characteristics in its oxidation states and reactivity. The element's creation supports the \"island of stability\" theory regarding the stability of certain superheavy nuclides.\n",

The [[1st Division (Iraq)|1st]] and [[5th Division (Iraq)|5th Mechanized Division]]s and [[3rd Division (Iraq)|3rd Armored Division]] were ordered to conduct a multi-pronged invasion toward Khafji, engaging Saudi Arabian, [[Kuwait]]i, and U.S. forces along the coastline, with a supporting Iraqi commando force ordered to infiltrate further south by sea and harass the Coalition's rear.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a360696.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128060231/https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a360696.pdf |url-status=live |archive-date=28 January 2020 |title=The Battle of Khafji: An Overview and Preliminary Analysis |last=Titus |first=James |date=1996 |website=Defense Technical Information Center |access-date=11 September 2019}}</ref>\\n\\nThese three divisions, which had suffered significant losses from attacks by Coalition aircraft in the preceding days, attacked on 29 January. Most of their attacks were repulsed by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] and [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] forces but one of the Iraqi columns occupied Khafji on the night of 29–30 January. Between 30 January and 1 February, two [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]] battalions and two Qatari tank companies attempted to retake control of the city, aided by Coalition aircraft and U.S. artillery. By 1 February, the city had been recaptured at the cost of 43 Coalition servicemen dead and 52 wounded. Iraqi Army fatalities numbered between 60 and 300, while an estimated 400 were captured as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].\\n\\nAlthough the invasion of Khafji was initially a propaganda victory for the [[Ba'athist Iraq]]i regime, the battle that led to its swift  recapture by Coalition forces demonstrated the importance of air support for  ground forces.\\n\\n==Background==\\nOn 2 August 1990, the [[Iraqi Army]] invaded and occupied the neighboring state of [[Kuwait]].<ref name=\"Lewis481\">Lewis, p. 481.</ref> The invasion, which followed the inconclusive [[Iran–Iraq War]] and three decades of political conflict with Kuwait, offered Saddam Hussein the opportunity to distract political dissent at home and add Kuwait's oil resources to Iraq's own, a boon in a time of declining petroleum prices.<ref>Halliday, p. 226. At the time, Iraq's own reserves were second only to Saudi Arabia's.</ref>\\n\\nIn response, the United Nations began to pass a series of resolutions demanding the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.<ref>Perrett, p. 199.</ref> Afraid that [[Saudi Arabia]] would be invaded next, the Saudi Arabian government requested immediate military aid.<ref>Perrett, pp. 199–200.</ref> As a result, the United States began marshalling forces from a variety of nations, styled the [[Coalition of the Gulf War|Coalition]], on the [[Arabian peninsula]].<ref>Halliday, p. 223.</ref> Initially, Saddam Hussein attempted to deter Coalition military action by threatening Kuwait's and Iraq's petroleum production and export. In December 1990, Iraq experimented with the use of explosives to destroy wellheads in the area of the Ahmadi loading complex, developing their capability to destroy Kuwait's petroleum infrastructure on a large scale. On 16 January, Iraqi artillery destroyed an oil storage tank in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and on 19 January the pumps at the Ahmadi loading complex were opened, pouring crude oil into the [[Persian Gulf]]. The oil flowed into the sea at a rate of {{convert|200,000|oilbbl|m3}} a day, becoming one of the worst ecological disasters to that date.<ref>Freedman & Karsh, p. 29.</ref>\\n\\nDespite these Iraqi threats, the Coalition launched a 38-day aerial campaign on 17 January 1991.<ref name=\"Lewis481\" /> Flying an estimated 2,000 sorties a day,<ref>Freedman & Karsh, pp. 24–25.</ref> Coalition aircraft rapidly crippled the Iraqi air defense systems and effectively destroyed the [[Iraqi Air Force]],<ref>Biddle, pp. 144–145.</ref> whose daily sortie rate plummeted from a prewar level of an estimated 200 per day to almost none by 17 January.<ref>Freedman & Karsh, p. 27.</ref> On the third day of the campaign, many Iraqi pilots fled across the Iranian border in their aircraft rather than be destroyed.<ref>Freedman & Karsh, pp. 27–28.</ref> The air campaign also targeted command-and-control sites, bridges, railroads, and petroleum storage facilities.<ref>Lewis, pp. 493–495.</ref>\\n\\nSaddam Hussein, who is believed to have said, \"The air force has never decided a war,\" nevertheless worried that the air campaign would erode Iraq's national morale. The Iraqi leader also believed that the United States would not be willing to lose many troops in action, and therefore sought to draw Coalition ground troops into a decisive battle.<ref>Freedman & Karsh, p. 28.</ref> In an attempt to provoke a ground battle, he directed Iraqi forces to launch [[Scud]] missiles against [[Israel]], while continuing to threaten the destruction of oilfields in Kuwait.<ref>Freedman & Karsh, pp. 29–30.</ref> These efforts were unsuccessful in provoking a large ground battle,<ref>Freedman & Karsh, p. 30.</ref> so Saddam Hussein decided to launch a limited offensive into Saudi Arabia with the aim of inflicting heavy losses on the Coalition armies.<ref>Titus, p. 4.</ref>\\n\\nAs the air campaign continued, the Coalition's expectations of an Iraqi offensive decreased. As a result, the United States redeployed the [[XVIII Airborne Corps (United States)|XVIII Airborne Corps]] and the [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] 480&nbsp;kilometers (300&nbsp;mi) to the west. The Coalition's leadership believed that should an Iraqi force go on the offensive, it would be launched from the al-Wafra oil fields, in Southern Kuwait.<ref>Titus, p. 5.</ref>\\n\\n==Order of battle==\\n<!--this map, as well as much of this section, is far more about the war as a whole than about this battle; most, if not all, of this should be deleted or moved to the article about the war-->\\n[[Image:DesertStormMap v2.svg|thumb|Coalition and Iraqi units deployed in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations, as of 24–28 February 1991.]]\\nThe Iraqi Army had between 350,000 and 500,000 soldiers in theater,<ref>Freedman & Karsh, p. 13; post-war estimates put Iraqi personnel at around 350,000, while prior to the war the Coalition estimated a strength of around 540,000 soldiers.</ref> organized into 51 divisions, including eight [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Republican Guard]] divisions.<ref name=\"Press13\">Press, p. 13.</ref> Republican Guard units normally received the newest equipment;<ref name=\"Press13\" /> for example, most of the estimated 1,000 [[T-72]] tanks in the Iraqi Army on the eve of the war were in Republican Guard divisions.<ref name=\"Zaloga38\">Zaloga (1993), p. 38.</ref> The Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (KTO) also included nine heavy divisions, composed mostly of professional soldiers, but with weapons of a generally lesser grade than those issued to the Republican Guard.<ref>Press, pp. 13–14.</ref>\\n\\nMost non-Republican Guard armored units had older tank designs, mainly the [[T-54/55|T-55]] or its Chinese equivalents, the [[Type 59 tank|Type 59]] and [[Type 69 tank|Type 69]].<ref>Zaloga (2004), p. 42.</ref> The remaining 34 divisions were composed of poorly trained conscripts.

Fourth Corps' commander was Major General Ayad Khalil Zaki. The 3rd Armored Division had a number of T-72 tanks, the only non-Republican Guard force to have them,<ref name=\"Zaloga38\" /> while the other armored battalions had [[T-62]]s and T-55s,<ref name=\"Westermeyer5\" /> a few of which had an Iraqi appliqué armor similar to the Soviet [[Reactive armour#Non-explosive and non-energetic reactive armour|bulging armor]] also known as \"brow\" laminate armor or BDD.\\n\\nDuring the battle of Khafji, these upgraded T-55s survived impacts from [[MILAN|MILAN anti-tank missiles]].<ref>Zaloga (2004), p. 36.</ref> These divisions also had armored personnel vehicles such as the [[BMP-1]], scout vehicles such as the [[BRDM-2]], and several types of artillery.<ref name=\"Westermeyer5\" /> Also deployed along this portion of the front, though not chosen to participate in the invasion, were five infantry divisions that were under orders to remain in their defensive positions along the border.<ref name=\"Westermeyer5\">Westermeyer, p. 5.</ref>\\n\\n[[Image:T-55AD 1 Bovington.jpg|thumb|An Iraqi modification of the [[T-54/55|T-55]] tank, codename ''Enigma'', used during the battle]]\\n[[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] reconnaissance estimated that the Iraqi Army had amassed around 60,000 troops across the border, near the Kuwaiti town of Wafra, in as many as 5 or 6 divisions.<ref name=\"Williams13\">Williams, p. 13.</ref> Infantry divisions normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit, although some infantry divisions could have up to eight brigades–however most infantry divisions along the border were understrength, primarily due to [[desertion]].<ref>Rottman, p. 51.</ref>\\n\\nArmored and mechanized divisions normally made use of three brigades, with each brigade having up to four combat battalions; depending on the division type, these were generally a three to one mix, with either three mechanized battalions and one armored battalion, or vice versa.<ref>Rottman, pp. 51–52.</ref> Given the size of the forces deployed across the border, it is thought that the Iraqi Army planned to continue the offensive, after the successful capture of Khafji, in order to seize the valuable oil fields at Dammam.<ref name=\"Williams13\" />\\n\\nThe attack would consist of a four-prong offensive. The 1st Mechanized Division would pass through the 7th and 14th Infantry Divisions to protect the flank of the 3rd Armored Division, which would provide a blocking force west of Khafji while the 5th Mechanized Division took the town. The 1st Mechanized and 3rd Armored divisions would then retire to Kuwait, while the 5th Mechanized Division would wait until the Coalition launched a counteroffensive. The principal objectives were to inflict heavy casualties on the attacking Coalition soldiers and take prisoners of war, who Saddam Hussein theorized would be an excellent bargaining tool with the Coalition.<ref>Westermeyer, pp. 5–6.</ref>\\n\\nAs the units moved to the [[Kuwait–Saudi Arabia border|Saudi Arabian border]], many were attacked by Coalition aircraft.

A Company of the 2nd Light Infantry Armored Battalion, which was screening the Iraqi unit, reported a column of 60–100 BMPs. The column was engaged by Coalition A-10s and Harrier jump jets. This was then followed by another column with an estimated 29 tanks. One of the column's T-62 tanks was engaged by an anti-tank missile and destroyed.<ref>Westermeyer, p. 20.</ref> Coalition air support, provided by A-10s and [[F-16]]s, engaged the Iraqi drive through observation post 1 and ultimately repulsed the attack back over the Kuwaiti border. Aircraft continued to engage the columns throughout the night, until the next morning.<ref>Williams, p. 38.</ref> Another column of Iraqi tanks, approaching observation post 2, were engaged by aircraft and also repulsed that night.<ref>Titus, p. 11.</ref>\\n\\n[[Image:RemnantsofLAV25.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|LAV-AT destroyed by a friendly anti-tank missile during the fighting around observation post 4, near Al Wafra.]]\\nAn additional Iraqi column crossed the Saudi Arabian border to the East, although still along the coast, towards the city of Khafji.<ref>Titus, p. 12.</ref> These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, as it had been ordered to not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open.<ref name=\"Westermeyer22\">Westermeyer, p. 22.</ref> At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi Arabian border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130]], destroying 13 vehicles.<ref>Williams, pp. 38–39.</ref>\\n\\nNevertheless, the Iraqi advance towards Khafji continued on this sector, despite repeated attacks from an AC-130. Attempts by the Saudi Arabian commanders to call in additional air strikes on the advancing Iraqi column failed when the requested heavy air support never arrived.<ref>Westermeyer, pp. 22–23.</ref> Khafji was occupied by approximately 00:30 on 30 January,<ref>Williams, p. 39.</ref> trapping two six-man reconnaissance teams from the 1st Marine Division in the city. The teams occupied two apartment buildings in the southern sector of the city and called artillery fire on their position to persuade the Iraqis to call off a search of the area.<ref>Williams, p. 41.</ref> Throughout the night, Coalition air support composed of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft continued to engage Iraqi tanks and artillery.<ref>Westermeyer, p. 23.</ref>\\n\\n===Initial response: 30 January===\\nDistressed by the occupation of Khafji, Saudi Arabian commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to U.S. General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]] for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces in and around the city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that the city would be retaken by Arab ground forces.<ref>Williams, p. 43.</ref> The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi Arabian infantry with [[Cadillac Gage Commando|V-150 armored cars]] and two Qatari tank companies attached to the task force.<ref>Mahnken & Watts, pp. 155–156.</ref><ref name=\"Westermeyer126-127\">Westermeyer (2014), pp. 126–127.</ref> These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.<ref>Westermeyer, pp. 25–26.</ref>\\n\\nThe force was put under the command of Saudi Arabian Lieutenant Colonel Matar, who moved out by 17:00 hours. The force met up with elements of the [[3rd Marine Regiment (United States)|U.S. 3rd Marine Regiment]], south of Khafji, and were ordered to directly attack the city.<ref>Stanton, p. 8.</ref> A platoon of Iraqi T-55s attacked south of the city, leading to the destruction of three [[T-55]]s by Qatari [[AMX-30]]s, and the capture of a fourth Iraqi tank.<ref name=\"Westermeyer27\">Westermeyer, p. 27.</ref> Lacking any coordinated artillery support,<ref name=\"Williams45\">Williams, p. 45.</ref> artillery fire was provided by the 10th Marine Regiment.<ref name=\"Westermeyer27\" />\\n\\n[[File:U.S. Marines in the Persian Gulf War (1991) 001.jpg|thumb|Supporting artillery from the [[10th Marine Regiment (United States)|10th Marine Regiment]].]]\\nAn initial attack on the city was called off after the Iraqi occupants opened up with heavy fire, prompting the Saudi Arabians to reinforce the 7th Battalion with two more companies from adjacent Saudi Arabian units.<ref>Stanton, pp. 8–9.</ref> The attempt to retake the city had been preceded by a 15-minute preparatory fire from U.S. Marine artillery. However Iraqi fire did manage to destroy one Saudi Arabian V-150.<ref name=Westermeyer28>Westermeyer, p. 28.</ref>\\n\\nMeanwhile, 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 5th Battalion moved north of Khafji to block Iraqi reinforcements attempting to reach the city. This unit was further bolstered by the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade, and heavily aided by Coalition air support. Although fear of friendly fire forced the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade to pull back the following morning, Coalition aircraft successfully hindered Iraqi attempts to move more soldiers down to Khafji and caused large numbers of Iraqi troops to surrender to Saudi Arabian forces.<ref name=Westermeyer28/>\\n\\nThat night, two U.S. Army heavy equipment transporters entered the city of Khafji, apparently lost, and were fired upon by Iraqi troops. Although one truck managed to turn around and escape, the two drivers of the second truck were wounded and captured. This led to a rescue mission organized by [[3rd Battalion 3rd Marines|3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment]], which sent a force of 30 men to extract the two wounded drivers. Although encountering no major opposition, they did not find the two drivers who had, by this time, been taken prisoner. The Marines did find a burnt out Qatari AMX-30, with its dead crew.<ref>Westermeyer, pp. 27–28; the two prisoners were released after the war.</ref> In the early morning hours, despite significant risk to their safety, an AC-130 providing overwatch stayed beyond sunrise. It was shot down by an Iraqi [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM), killing the aircraft's crew of 14.<ref>Westermeyer, pp. 29–30.</ref>\\n\\nThe interdiction on the part of Coalition aircraft and Saudi Arabian and Qatari ground forces was having an effect on the occupying Iraqi troops. Referring to Saddam Hussein's naming of the ground engagement as the \"mother of all battles\", Iraqi General Salah radioed in a request to withdraw, stating, \"The mother was killing her children.\"<ref>Westermeyer, p. 30.</ref> Since the beginning of the battle, Coalition aircraft had flown at least 350 sorties against Iraqi units in the area and on the night of 30–31 January, Coalition air support also began to attack units of the Iraqi Third Corps assembled on the Saudi Arabian border.<ref>Williams, pp. 46–47.</ref>\\n\\n===Recapture of Khafji: 31 January&nbsp;– 1 February===\\nOn 31 January, the effort to retake the city began anew. The attack was launched at 08:30 hours, and was met by heavy but mostly inaccurate Iraqi fire; however, three Saudi Arabian V-150 armored cars were knocked out by [[RPG-7]]s at close range.<ref>Westermeyer, p. 31, and Tucker-Jones, p. 61, claim that three were knocked out, while Stanton, p. 9, claims that two were destroyed.</ref> The 8th battalion of the Saudi Arabian brigade was ordered to deploy to the city by 10:00 hours, while 5th Battalion to the north engaged another column of Iraqi tanks attempting to reach the city. The latter engagement led to the destruction of around 13 Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers, and the capture of 6 more vehicles and 116 Iraqi soldiers, costing the Saudi Arabian battalion two dead and two wounded. The 8th Battalion engaged the city from the northeast, linking up with 7th Battalion. These units cleared the southern portion of the city, until 7th Battalion withdrew south to rest and rearm at 18:30 hours, while the 8th remained in Khafji.<ref name=\"Stanton9\">Stanton, p. 9.</ref> The two Qatari tank companies, with U.S. Marine artillery and air support, moved north of the city to block Iraqi reinforcements.<ref name=\"Westermeyer126-127\"/>\\n\\nThe 8th continued clearing buildings and by the time the 7th had withdrawn to the south, the Saudi Arabians had lost approximately 18 dead and 50 wounded, as well as seven V-150 vehicles. Coalition aircraft continued to provide heavy support throughout the day and night.<ref>Westermeyer, p. 31.</ref> A veteran of the Iran-Iraq War later mentioned that Coalition airpower \"imposed more damage on his brigade in half an hour than it had sustained in eight years of fighting against the Iranians.\"<ref>Westermeyer, pp. 31–32.</ref> During the battle, an Iraqi amphibious force was sent to land on the coast and moved into Khafji. As the boats made their way through the [[Persian Gulf]] towards Khafji, U.S. and British aircraft caught the Iraqi boats in the open and destroyed over 90% of the Iraqi amphibious force.<ref>Desert Storm-The Ground assault-video ordnance.</ref>\\n\\nThe Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti units renewed operations the following day. Two Iraqi companies, with about 20 armored vehicles, remained in the city and had not attempted to break out during the night. While the Saudi Arabian 8th Battalion continued operations in the southern portion of the city, the 7th Battalion began to clear the northern sector of the city. Iraqi resistance was sporadic and most Iraqi soldiers surrendered on sight; as a result, the city was recaptured on 1 February 1991.<ref>Stanton, pp. 9–10.</ref>\\n\\n==Aftermath==\\n[[File:Cleaning up Khafji.jpg|thumb|Marines of the U.S. [[3rd Battalion 3rd Marines]], depicted in the painting ''Cleaning up Khafji''.]]\\nDuring the battle, Coalition forces incurred 43 fatalities and 52 injured casualties. This included 25 Americans killed, 11 of them by [[friendly fire]] along with 14 airmen killed when their [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130]] was shot down by Iraqi SAMs. The U.S. also had two soldiers wounded and another two soldiers were captured in Khafji.<ref name=\"Westermeyer132\">Westermeyer 2014, p. 132.</ref>\\n\\nSaudi Arabian casualties totaled 18 killed and 50 wounded. Two Saudi [[main battle tank]]s and ten lightly armored V-150s were knocked out.<ref name=\"Westermeyer132\" /> Most of the V150s were knocked out by RPG-7 fire in close-range fighting inside the town of Khafji. One of the two main battle tanks was hit by a 100mm main gun round from a T-55.<ref name=\"Stanton10\">Stanton, p. 10.</ref>\\n\\nIraq listed its casualties as 71 dead, 148 wounded and 702 missing. U.S. sources present at the battle claim that 300 Iraqis lost their lives, and at least 90 vehicles were destroyed.<ref name=\"Westermeyer132\" /> Another source suggests that 60 Iraqi soldiers were killed and at least 400 taken prisoner, while no less than 80 armored vehicles were knocked out; however these casualties are attributed to the fighting both inside and directly north of Khafji.<ref name=\"Stanton10\" />\\n\\nWhatever the exact casualties, the majority of three Iraqi mechanized/armored divisions had been destroyed.<ref>Williams, p. 52.</ref>\\n\\nThe Iraqi capture of Khafji was a major propaganda victory for Iraq: on 30 January Iraqi radio claimed that they had \"expelled Americans from the Arab territory\".<ref>Williams, p. 19.</ref> For many in the Arab world, the battle of Khafji was seen as an Iraqi victory, and Hussein made every possible effort to turn the battle into a political victory.<ref>Williams, p. 56.</ref> On the other side, confidence within the United States Armed Forces in the abilities of the Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti armies increased as the battle progressed. After Khafji, the Coalition's leadership began to sense that the Iraqi Army was a \"hollow force\" and it provided them with an impression of the degree of resistance they would face during the Coalition's ground offensive that would begin later that month. The battle was felt by the Saudi Arabian government to be a major propaganda victory, which had successfully defended its territory.<ref>Westermeyer, pp. 32–33.</ref>\\n\\nDespite the success of the engagements between 29 January and 1 February, the Coalition did not launch its main offensive into Kuwait and Iraq until the night of 24–25 February.<ref>Freedman & Karsh, p. 33.</ref><ref>Press, p. 1.</ref> The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later.<ref>Freedman & Karsh, p. 34.</ref> The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of the manner in which [[Operation Desert Storm]] would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for nearly half of the U.S. dead.<ref>Williams, pp. 23–24.</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist|30em}}\\n\\n==Sources==\\n{{Refbegin}}\\n* {{cite journal |last=Biddle |first=Stephen |title=Victory Misunderstood: What the Gulf War Tells us About the Future of Conflict |journal=International Security |volume=21 |issue=2 |jstor=2539073 |pages=139–179 |publisher=The [[MIT Press]] |date=Autumn 1996 |doi=10.2307/2539073}}\\n* {{cite book |last=Foss |first=Christopher F. |title=Jane's Tank Recognition Guide |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2006 |location=London, United Kingdom |isbn=978-0-00-718326-5}}\\n* {{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=Lawrence |author2=Efraim Karsh |title=How Kuwait Was Won: Strategy in the Gulf War |journal=International Security |volume=16 |issue=2 |jstor=2539059 |pages=5–41 |publisher=The MIT Press |date=Autumn 1991 |doi=10.2307/2539059 |s2cid=154290155}}\\n* {{cite web |title=Gulf War Facts |work=CNN |publisher=CNN.com |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/gulf.war/facts/gulfwar/ |access-date=12 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612131747/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/gulf.war/facts/gulfwar/ |archive-date=12 June 2008 }}\\n* {{cite journal |last=Halliday |first=Fred |title=The Gulf War and its Aftermath: First Reflections |journal=International Affairs |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=223–234 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |date=April 1991 |doi=10.2307/2620827 |jstor=2620827 |s2cid=154565052}}\\n* {{cite book |title=Lucrative targets : the U.S. Air Force in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations |url=https://archive.org/details/lucrativetargets00jami |first=Perry |last=Jamieson |publisher=Air Force History and Museums Program |year=2001 |isbn=0160509580 }}\\n* {{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=Michael W. |title=The Law of Aerial Bombardment in the 1991 Gulf War |journal=The American Journal of International Law |volume=97 |issue=3 |jstor=3109837 |pages=481–509 |publisher=American Society of International Law |date=July 2003 |doi=10.2307/3109837 |s2cid=144600724}}\\n* {{cite journal |last=Mahnken |first=Thomas G. |author2=Barry D.

Located near the Saudi-Kuwait border, Khafji saw Iraqi forces led by Saddam Hussein attempt an invasion to provoke a ground war against the Coalition, which included the United States, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Kuwait. The Iraqi forces, comprising the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Divisions, clashed with Coalition troops, including Saudi Arabian National Guard and Royal Saudi Marine units, as well as U.S. Marines. Despite initial Iraqi gains, the Coalition repelled the invaders, resulting in a Coalition victory. Casualties were reported with the Coalition suffering fewer losses compared to the Iraqi estimates provided by both sides. The battle marked the first substantial ground combat of the Gulf War.\n",

Maladie}}\\nL{{'}}'''angiocholite''' est une '''infection de la bile sur obstacle lithiasique obstruant la voie biliaire principale.'''\\n\\n== Physiopathologie ==\\nToute élévation de la pression au-delà de {{Unité/2|35|cm}} d'eau a pour conséquence une distension des [[voies biliaires]] qui se traduit sur le plan clinique par une douleur de type biliaire, la rétention de bile infectée des canalicules biliaires vers les sinusoïdes puis vers la circulation générale à travers le carrefour cavo-sus-hépatique : c'est le reflux cholangio-veineux, avec comme conséquence un ictère et une [[bactériémie]] (frissons). Dans les formes graves, la bile infectée se trouve sous une haute pression à l’intérieur des voies biliaires, la bactériémie est alors massive et répétée : c'est une véritable [[Sepsis|septicémie]]. La libération d'endotoxines bactériennes et des médiateurs leucocytaires de l'inflammation déclenche une cascade de réactions aboutissant à la défaillance uni- ou polyviscérale. Par ailleurs la rétention d'[[Acide biliaire|acides biliaires]], néphrotoxiques, peuvent entrainer une [[insuffisance rénale aiguë]] (IRA) par [[nécrose tubulaire aiguë]]<ref name=\"fickert2013\">{{Cite pmid |23813550}}</ref>{{,}}<ref name=\"krones2015\">{{Cite pmid |26045271}}</ref>. Le reflux massif et répété de bile infectée à travers le foie fait que ses moyens d'épuration sont dépassés, il en résulte la formation d’[[abcès]] hépatiques abcès angiocholitiques).\\n\\nL'obstruction brutale de la [[voie biliaire principale]] (le plus souvent {{Incise |90 % des cas}} par un [[calcul biliaire]] issu de la vésicule, parfois par des [[Parasite (médecine)|parasites]]<ref name=Senn2010> {{article | issn = 1660-9379 | volume = 6 |numéro=273 |pages=2292, 2294-2296, 2298-2301 |auteurs=Nicolas Senn, Émilie Fasel, Serge de Vallière, Blaise Genton |titre=Troubles digestifs associés aux protozoaires et aux helmintes : prise en charge par le médecin de famille [Gastrointestinal complaints associated to helminth and protozoan: management by the general practitioner] | pmid = 21207722 |lien périodique=Revue médicale suisse |périodique=Rev Med Suisse |consulté le = 6 juin 2012 |date = 1 décembre 2010 |url = http://rms.medhyg.ch/numero-273-page-2292.htm}}</ref>, ou par une [[tumeur]] type papillomatose) va entraîner la stase biliaire, avec la douleur de distension hépatique. Ce liquide de stase va se [[surinfection|surinfecter]], avec des risques de passages bactériémiques (proximité des pédicules portaux et des canalicules biliaires dans l'ensemble du foie ; importance du débit sanguin intra-hépatique).

Ces signes cliniques sont pathognomoniques, et imposent dès l'arrivée du patient de commencer le traitement médical : réhydratation intraveineuse, [[antibiotique à large spectre]].\\n\\nEn cas d'évolution de l'angiocholite, les choses s'aggravent rapidement, avec constitution d'un choc septique, anurie, coma, voire décès rapide en l'absence de traitement.\\n\\nLes signes peuvent être dissociés, dans des tableaux d'obstruction incomplète : douleur et fièvre, avec un ictère fluctuant, ou fièvre isolée.\\n\\n== Examens complémentaires ==\\nUn bilan biologique doit être réalisé rapidement, pour quantifier la cholestase et le syndrome inflammatoire. Il est également nécessaire de faire un bilan de la fonction [[rein|rénale]], de la [[coagulation sanguine]], du pH sanguin, pour vérifier l'absence de complications.\\n\\nL'[[échographie]] confirme rapidement la dilatation des voies biliaires intra-hépatiques, et permet parfois de voir le calcul cholédocien responsable. Le scanner montre les mêmes images, sans apporter de précision.\\n\\nL'[[Imagerie par résonance magnétique|IRM]] des voies biliaires (MRCP) n'est réalisée que si l'échographie est équivoque, que la CPRE (cholangio-pancréatographie rétrograde endoscopique) n'est pas disponible et si elle ne fait pas perdre de temps dans la prise en charge du patient. Dans les problèmes biliaires, c'est la situation où elle a le moins d'intérêt, les techniques [[endoscopie|endoscopiques]] permettant de réaliser un traitement d'urgence.\\n\\nOn doit en effet programmer rapidement un cathétérisme rétrograde de la papille (CPRE : cholangio-pancréatographie rétrograde endoscopique) : dans les heures qui suivent le [[diagnostic (médecine)|diagnostic]] si le traitement médical n'a pas amélioré l'état du patient, dans les jours qui suivent l'admission si le patient répond au traitement. Cet examen pourra être précédé, dans le même temps [[anesthésie|anesthésique]], par une écho-endoscopie, qui confirmera l'obstacle et en précisera la nature. Le cathétérisme de la papille permet de réaliser une sphinctérotomie, et une extraction des calculs de la voie biliaire principale. On laisse un drain naso-biliaire, si un contrôle est souhaité, et si l'inflammation est très importante. On met parfois en place une prothèse biliaire.\\n\\n== Traitement ==\\nL'angiocholite est une urgence médicale<ref name=deSaussure2010/>. Dès la suspicion de ce diagnostic, il convient de mettre en place une voie veineuse, qui permet d'amorcer une réhydratation, et une [[antibiothérapie]] à large spectre.

Le [[corps simple]] cobalt a des propriétés physiques assez voisines de celles du [[fer]] et du nickel. D'un point de vue chimique, il est moins réactif que le fer.\\nLe cobalt est aussi un [[Éléments du groupe 9|élément du groupe 9]], dont les trois premiers Co, Rh et Ir constituent le groupe du cobalt.\\n\\nDes minéraux naturels de cobalt, sous forme de peintures, émaux ou vernis, sont utilisés depuis la plus haute Antiquité, en particulier vers 2600 {{av JC}} en [[Égypte antique|Égypte]] ou dans les civilisations de Mésopotamie ayant donné naissance à [[Babylone]]. Ainsi l'archéologue retrouve des décors bleus sur des poteries ou vaisselles de terre cuite. Des perles de verre teinté au bleu de cobalt sont communes vers {{date-|-2200}} dans l'actuel Iran. Ces techniques pour colorer le verre d'un [[Bleu de cobalt|bleu intense]] ou obtenir des émaux sont communes dans le monde méditerranéen dès le {{-s-|III}} Ce sont généralement des silicates et/ou aluminates de cobalt et de potassium, nommés autrefois [[safre]] ou [[smalt]] reconnus en Europe occidentale dans certains vitraux romans de luxe, ou plus tard d'oxydes de cobalt nommés \"[[bleu de cobalt]]\".\\n\\n''Das Kobold'' ou ''das Kobalt'' est le nom traditionnel que les mineurs saxons à la recherche de métaux précieux attribuent à ces dérivés trompeurs. Ces minerais généralement soufrés et/ou arséniés trop riches en cobalt donnent par traitement métallurgique des gaz malodorants ou des fumées d'oxydes toxiques à base de trioxyde d'arsenic, des émanations vénéneuses et, si on chauffe outre mesure, une coulée de matière fondue, cassante à froid, le [[speiss]] ou des métaux durs et cassants à hautes teneurs en sulfures ou en arsenic que les métallurgistes ne savent ni traiter ni forger. Les mineurs croyaient alors le quartier minier ensorcelé par des nains maléfiques et falsificateurs, facétieux et voleurs, les [[kobold]]s d'aspect bleuâtre et mortifères qui avaient dérobé le métal précieux, très souvent le cuivre, et remplacé par cette matière impropre et confuse <ref group=alpha>Aujourd'hui, en allemand, le substantif ''« der Kobold »'' au singulier, ''« die Kobolde »'' au pluriel, correspond ''grosso modo'' au lutin. Pourtant, par respect pour la tradition paysanne minière, il ne faut pas confondre ces petits êtres miniers avec les lutins homonymes, kobolds ou gobelins, qui hantent les pays de forêts ou de prairies marécageuses. Ce ne sont pas non plus des nains nickels, facétieux et verdâtres. Rappelons la même logique du folklore nordique à l’œuvre dans les appellations du [[Quartz (minéral)|quartz]], [[nickel]], [[Tungstène|wolfram]].</ref>.\\n\\nCes minerais sans valeur ou leurs sous-produits sont nommés en allemand vernaculaire par un substantif neutre ''Kobelet'', ''Kobolt'' ou ''Kobelt''. [[Paracelse]] mentionne le ''cobolt'' en 1522 avec une graphie plus latine. Le latin ''coboltum'' ou ''cobaltum'' s'impose ensuite dans l'Europe savante. Notons que le terme technique cobolt a aussi désigné en français l'arsenic métallique réduit en poudre <ref group=alpha>En réalité, il s'agit du corps simple As dont les surfaces sont déjà largement oxydées en oxydes arsénieux au contact de l'air.</ref>.\\n\\nJusqu'au {{s-|XVIII|e}} et au siècle suivant, le terme de « cobalt » et sa variante ''cobolt'', désigne le minerai ou son résidu autrefois la plupart du temps inutilisables. Pourtant, dès le {{s-|XVII}} avec la mode germanique du ''Blaufarbung'', c'est-à-dire de la coloration en bleu, le minerai de cobalt retrouve une plus grande utilité car les hommes de l'art chymique et verrier fabriquent avec ce déchet d'excellents pigments bleus, notamment le smalt des verriers ou des céramistes, le \"bleu des crayons de charron\"... [[Georg Brandt]], spécialiste des minéraux arséniés, s'efforce de reconnaître l'élément spécifique sous-jacent à ses minerais ou sous-produits miniers entre 1733 et 1738.\\n\\nA Venise, les maîtres verriers de Murano sollicitèrent les nains de Venise pour s'approvisionner en minerai de cobalt et produire leurs fameuses œuvres teintées en bleu de Murano. Les nains rapportaient ce minerai des mines au nord des Alpes, où ils étaient affublés du terme de [[kobold]] (lutin, ou [[Gobelin (folklore)|goblin]], créature surnaturelle)<ref>{{Lien web|langue=fr|titre=Le mystère des Nains (les chasseurs de trésors de Venise)|url=http://histoirelegendaire.blogspot.com/2014/01/le-mystere-des-nains-les-chasseurs-de.html|consulté le=2020-04-22}}</ref>.\\n\\nEn 1735, le chimiste suédois Georg Brandt ([[1694]]-[[1768]]) affirme avoir extrait de ce minerai un « semi-métal » blanc rougeâtre, dur et cassant, en réalité des échantillons de métal impur qu'il nomme « cobalt »<ref>G. Brandt, \"Dissertatio de Semi-Metallis\", ''Acta literaria et scientiarum Sueciae'', vol. IV, 1735, {{p.|1-12}}. Uppsala, 1742.</ref>. En 1745, il démontre que le cobalt est la cause de la couleur bleue que le minerai de cobalt communique aux verres<ref>G. Brandt, ''Cobalti nova species examinata et descripta'', ''Acta Societatis regiae scientiarum upsaliensis'', 1742, {{p.|33-41}}. Stockholm, 1748.</ref>. Cette précision n'est pas inutile car la communauté savante attribuait le plus souvent la couleur bleue soit au [[bismuth]], soit au fer et à l'arsenic<ref>F. Delamare, ''Saffre, smalt, bleu d'esmail et azur'', in ''Bleus en poudres, de l'Art à l'Industrie'', Mines Paris, ParisTech, Les Presses, 2008, {{p.|71-122}}.</ref>.\\n\\nMais ces travaux passent pour la plupart pratiquement inaperçus. Il faut attendre 1780 pour que [[Torbern Olof Bergman]] prépare le métal pur et reconnaisse tardivement le rôle pionnier de Georg Brandt dans la découverte d'un élément, alors confirmée. En 1798, les chimistes constatent que les solutions ammoniacales de chlorure de cobalt {{fchim|CoCl|2|}} laissent précipiter des cristaux orangés stables à la chaleur, jusqu'à {{tmp|180|°C}}, corps qui se transforme en un autre corps stable plus foncé au-delà de cette température<ref group=alpha>Le premier corps précipité, composé de Co(II) est plus tard décrit par la formule {{formule chimique|[CoCl|3|. 6 (NH|3|)]}} et le second corps composé de cobalt (III) bien plus tard du temps d'Alfred Werner, découvreur de leur structure complexe, par {{formule chimique|[Co<sup>III</sup>(NH|3|)|6|] Cl|3|}}, soit le chlorure d'hexa-ammine cobalt (III).</ref>\\n\\nLes pigments bleus de cobalt intéressent au {{s-|XVIII|e}} et {{s-|XIX|e}} encore plus l'industrie de la céramique et surtout celle plus récente de la porcelaine. Ainsi est mis au point le « bleu de Sèvres » et plus tard le « bleu de Thénard », obtenu par [[calcination]] du phosphate de cobalt et de l'alumine gélatineuse. Mais le bleu de cobalt est le plus souvent un pigment à base d'oxyde de cobalt. Ce pigment est utilisé pour les verres et la pâte céramique, il sert toujours à l'émaillage et à la décoration des couvertes ou carreaux céramiques.\\n[[Fichier:Ewer, Qing dynasty, Qianlong period, porcelain, Honolulu Museum of Art.JPG|gauche|vignette|Vase en porcelaine qing]]\\nPendant le {{XIXe siècle}}, le [[Bleu de cobalt|bleu cobalt]] est produit par la fabrique norvégienne Blaafarveværket (70-80 % de la production mondiale) dirigée par l'industriel prussien Benjamin Wegner.\\n\\nAvant la [[Belle Époque]], les applications directes se multiplient. Le cobalt, allié au fer et à l'acier, permet d'accroître la dureté des matériaux obtenus. Le revêtement d'une couche de métal cobalt, plus dure que celle du nickel, permet de protéger des métaux trop facilement oxydables, à commencer par le fer. Le « cobaltage » rivalise avec le nickelage pour certaines applications. Les sels de cobalt deviennent communs dans les laboratoires de chimie. Ils permettent de mettre au point des encres sympathiques de plus en plus sophistiquées, et plus prosaïquement des papiers indicateurs d'hygrométrie, c'est-à-dire d'humidité de l'air ou d'un mélange gazeux quelconque. Le papier hygrométrique ou [[Papier de dichlorure de cobalt|papier cobalté]] vire du bleu au rose selon le degré d'humidité de l'air.\\n\\nLa chimie du cobalt en [[solution aqueuse]] et particulièrement la formation de complexes sont particulièrement riches.\\nLes bases de la [[Complexe (chimie)|chimie de coordination]] sont posées avant 1893 par les travaux pionniers du chimiste mulhousien [[Alfred Werner]] au début du {{s|XX|e}}, essentiellement avec des complexes de cobalt<ref group=alpha>Alfred Werner reçoit le prix Nobel de chimie en 1913, mais sa « théorie de la coordination » est proposée en 1893. Elle est basée sur l'aspect structural, en particulier l'isomérie et l'activité optique des complexes minéraux.</ref>. Ce chimiste naturalisé suisse en 1895 fut le premier à proposer que les complexes soient constitués d'un ion métallique entouré de [[Ligand (chimie)|ligands]], et non d'un ion métallique accroché à une chaîne de ligands, comme le soutenaient les chimistes de l'époque à la suite de [[Sophus Mads Jørgensen|Jorgensen]].\\n\\nEn [[1938]], [[John Livingood]] et [[Glenn Seaborg]] découvrent le cobalt 60.\\n\\n=== Lexique ===\\nLe mot de genre masculin, le cobalt, apparaît en français en 1549 sous la plume de [[Pierre Belon]] pour décrire le minerai cobaltifère et ses avatars métallurgiques<ref>[http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/cobalt]</ref>.\\n\\nL'adjectif ''cobaltifère'' qualifie les corps ou les matières qui contiennent l'élément cobalt. Les verbes ''cobaltiser'' ou ''cobalter'' signifient couvrir d'une couche de métal cobalt. Le ''cobaltage'' ou encore le ''cobaltisage'' est le dépôt protecteur de cobalt, en général une mince couche, sur la surface d'un autre métal plus fragile ou corrodable.\\n\\nLes adjectifs ''cobalteux'' et ''cobaltique'' qualifient respectivement les sels et composés de Co(II) et Co(III).\\n\\nLa cobaltothérapie désigne l'emploi des rayonnements du cobalt 60 en thérapie du cancer.\\n\\n== Isotopes ==\\n{{article détaillé|Isotopes du cobalt|Cobalt 60}}\\n\\nLe cobalt est un [[élément monoisotopique]] et [[élément mononucléidique|mononucléidique]] : il n'existe à l'état naturel que sous la forme d'un seul [[isotope]], [[isotope stable]], <sup>59</sup>Co. On lui attribue une [[masse atomique]] standard de 58,933195(5) [[unité de masse atomique unifiée|u]].\\nCependant, 28 [[radioisotope]]s artificiels ont été caractérisés, le plus « stable » étant le [[cobalt 60|<sup>60</sup>Co]] avec une [[demi-vie]] 5,2714 ans, suivi de <sup>57</sup>Co avec une demi-vie de 271,79 jours, de <sup>56</sup>Co (77,27 jours) et <sup>58</sup>Co ({{nombre|70.86|jours}}). Tous les autres isotopes ont une demi-vie inférieure à 18 heures et pour la majorité d'entre eux inférieure à une seconde. Le cobalt possède également 11 [[isomérie nucléaire|isomères nucléaires]], tous ayant une demi-vie inférieure à 15 minutes.\\n\\n=== Cobalt&nbsp;60 (isotope radioactif) ===\\n{{Article détaillé|cobalt 60}}\\n\\nLe cobalt&nbsp;60 a de nombreuses utilisations comme source de [[rayon gamma|rayons gamma γ]], en raison de sa demi-vie relativement courte (5,27 ans), donc plus facile à éliminer en comparaison d'autres isotopes émetteurs de telles particules. On retrouve ainsi les « bombes au cobalt 60 », sources de rayons γ de {{unité|1,17|et=1,33|MeV}} :\\n* en [[radiothérapie]] des unités de médecine spécialisées en cancérologie, où elles ont remplacé les techniques au [[radium]] mises au point par [[Marie Curie]] ;\\n* dans le traitement par radiation de la nourriture pour sa [[Stérilisation (microbiologie)|stérilisation]] ;\\n* dans le contrôle industriel des matériaux par radiographie pour repérer les défauts des pièces.\\n[[Fichier:Cobalt 60.png|vignette|Schéma simplifié de desintégration du cobalt 60|gauche]]Toutefois, le cobalt&nbsp;60 de synthèse (produit par exposition de cobalt « naturel », l'isotope 59, aux rayonnements neutroniques d'un réacteur nucléaire) n'est pas totalement pur, et contient toujours d'autres isotopes radioactifs à [[capture électronique|désintégration ε]] (epsilon), émetteurs de [[rayonnement gamma]] dangereux<ref group=alpha>En toute rigueur ce n'est pas l'isotope qui subit la désintégration ε qui émet le rayonnement gamma, mais la fraction de l'isotope produit dans un état excité. Mais comme la désexcitation (du nouvel isotope) suit la transformation radioactive, elle y est liée.</ref> car ce rayonnement hautement énergétique détruit les noyaux et les contamine en éléments radioactifs persistants.\\n\\nDe plus l'enrichissement et la purification du cobalt&nbsp;60 nécessitent des techniques de centrifugation similaires à celles utilisées pour l'enrichissement des isotopes à usage militaire, techniques hautement surveillées car stratégiques sur le plan international.\\n\\nAussi, on préfère maintenant utiliser des accélérateurs d'électrons, semblables aux [[tube cathodique|tubes cathodiques]] de nos moniteurs et téléviseurs mais à des niveaux d'accélération bien supérieurs, qui produisent des flux plus purs et mieux contrôlés de particules bêta. Mais leur utilisation nécessite un équipement beaucoup plus lourd qu'une simple capsule de cobalt&nbsp;60.

Il s'agit d'un élément assez peu abondant sur la croûte terrestre. Il est souvent associé au Cu, Ni, Pb, Ag et Fe.\\n\\nLe [[cobalt natif]] a été reconnu sur terre, mais il est très rare et n'est pas encore admis par l'[[Association internationale de minéralogie|IMA]]. Le cobalt natif est aussi présent dans les météorites.\\n\\nIl entre dans la composition de nombreux silicates, comme l'[[augite]], la [[biotite]], l'[[hornblende]], l'[[olivine]]... Il est ainsi beaucoup plus présent dans les roches magmatiques basiques et ultra-basiques que sont les [[gabbro]]s et les [[péridotite]]s.\\n\\nOn trouve aussi des composés de cobalt dans les nodules manganésifères, du plancher marin du l'[[océan Pacifique]] et surtout à faible profondeur marine dans les [[Encroûtement cobaltifère|encroûtements cobaltifères]] caractéristiques de certains atolls polynésiens.\\n\\n=== Minerais et extractions minières ===\\n[[Fichier:Cobaltite (Cobalt, Ontario, Canada) 1 (18599849584).jpg|vignette|Cobaltite, musée des Sciences naturelles de Denver]]\\n{{Article détaillé|Extraction du cobalt}}\\nSes principaux minerais se trouvent sous forme d'arséniures, d'arsénio-sulfures, de sulfures et d'oxydes, d'arséniates.

Il est plus dur et plus cassant que le fer. Mais le métal pur est suffisamment ductile et malléable pour pouvoir être forgé, laminé à chaud et à froid, étiré en fil.\\n\\nIl existe deux variétés [[Allotropie|allotropiques]] de cobalt. Le {{fchim|Co|α}} est un cristal métallique de maille hexagonale, avec les paramètres ''a'' = {{unité|2.507 Å}} et ''c'' = {{unité|4.069 Å}}, de densité 8,9 à {{tmp|20|°C}}, le plus stable à température ambiante et le {{fchim|Co|β}} de maille cubique faces centrées, ''a'' = {{unité|3.544 Å}}, moins compacte et nettement moins stable en dessous de {{tmp|400|°C}}. La transition de phase entre {{fchim|Co|α}} et {{fchim|Co|β}} avec accroissement de volume de 0,3 % s'opère à {{tmp|417|°C}} ± {{tmp|7|°C}}, elle est sensible à certaines impuretés spécifiques<ref>Roger Rumbu, ''Métallurgie extractive du cobalt'', opus cité, en particulier pp 36-40</ref>. Mais cette transition est lente, et il subsiste assez communément un mélange des deux variétés sur une large gamme de températures, ce qui explique les légères variations de propriétés physiques du matériau métal cobalt. {{fchim|Co|β}} est une forme métastable à température ambiante peut néanmoins être obtenue par trempe ou par certains procédés d'électrolyse. Il est probable que la transition différée joue un rôle dans l'éclatement de certains dépôts cathodiques de cobalt par électrolyse.\\n\\nCe corps est [[Ferromagnétisme|ferromagnétique]] (capable de conserver une forte [[aimantation]]) à température ordinaire. Le [[point de Curie]] avoisine {{tmp|1121|°C}}. La [[Perméabilité magnétique|perméabilité relative]] est de l'ordre de 68, soit deux tiers de celle du fer, avec un maximum de 245. Le [[champ coercitif]] avoisine 707 A/m.\\n\\nLa [[conductivité électrique]] est 26 % IACS, c'est-à-dire un peu plus du quart de celle du [[cuivre]] pur.\\n\\nIl est aussi peu fusible que le fer. Il fond au-dessus de {{tmp|1490|°C}}, pur à {{tmp|1495|°C}}. Il bout vers {{tmp|2927|°C}}, en pratique entre {{tmp|2600|°C}} et {{tmp|3100|°C}}.\\n\\nL'eau et l'air sont sans action en pratique sur le métal cobalt. Le cobalt massif est inaltérable à l'air froid, il est stable à l'air et l'eau à température ambiante. Ce n'est pas le cas du cobalt finement divisé en poudre qui s'enflamme à l'air ou qui n'est pas insoluble dans l'eau, avec une [[solubilité]] atteignant {{unité|1.1 mg/L}}. Ce type de cobalt pyrophorique et pulvérulent est obtenu par chauffage au rouge de l'oxyde de cobalt (II) {{formule chimique|CoO}} dans un courant de gaz hydrogène. Il peut constituer des mousses de cobalt qui peuvent dissoudre 100 volumes de gaz hydrogène.\\n\\nToutefois le cobalt massif ne s'oxyde radicalement que chauffé au rouge :\\n: 3 {{fchim|Co}} <sub>solide chauffé au rouge </sub> + 2 {{fchim|O|2|}} <sub>oxygène</sub> → {{formule chimique|Co|3|O|4|}} <sub>oxyde mixte noir</sub>\\nou\\n: {{fchim|Co}} <sub>solide chauffé au rouge </sub> + {{fchim|H|2|O}} <sub>vapeur</sub> → {{formule chimique|Co||O||}} <sub>oxyde solide noir</sub> + {{fchim|H|2|}} <sub>gaz hydrogène</sub>\\n\\nL'oxydation du cobalt en surface commence pourtant entre {{tmp|300|°C}} et {{tmp|900|°C}} de manière similaire à la première réaction. Au-delà de cette dernière température, l'[[oxyde mixte]] se transforme en oxyde divalent {{formule chimique|CoO}}.\\n\\nIl est rapidement soluble dans les acides oxydants dilués, comme l'[[acide nitrique]] qui forme un abondant [[précipité]] rouge de nitrate de cobalt {{formule chimique|Co(NO|3|)|2|}}.

Les bases fortes, comme les hydroxydes alcalins, sont pratiquement sans action.\\n\\n=== Préparation du corps simple, production ===\\nUne technique ancienne permet de traiter les minerais arséniés au laboratoire :\\n: {{fchim|CoAs}} <sub>solide</sub> + 2 {{fchim|K|2|CO|3|}}<sub>potasse</sub> + 4 {{fchim|S}} <sub>eau</sub> → {{formule chimique|CoS}} <sub>sulfure de cobalt, solide</sub> + {{fchim|KSAs}} <sub>sulfoarséniure de potassium</sub>\\n\\nLe sulfoarséniure de potassium est soluble dans l'eau, alors que le sulfure de cobalt précipite ou reste solide. Ce dernier est lavé puis traité par l'acide sulfurique. Le sulfate de cobalt est repris par la potasse caustique qui laisse un précipité d'oxyde de cobalt hydraté. Par chauffage, on obtient un oxyde de cobalt le plus souvent impur.\\n\\nL'[[Oxyde de cobalt(II)|oxyde de cobalt]], s'il est exempt d'impuretés, peut être calciné avec du charbon actif pour obtenir du cobalt métal. Néanmoins, pour séparer le nickel du cobalt {{fchim|NiO}}, l'oxyde de cobalt {{fchim|CoO}} est précipité de ces solutions aqueuses par l'acide oxalique. Une redissolution est obtenue dans l'ammoniaque pure. L'oxalate de nickel donne un précipité bleu verdâtre en premier lieu. L'oxalate de cobalt rose est décanté avec la liqueur restante, un oxalate de cobalt purifié bien rose est ensuite séché. Sa décomposition par la chaleur laisse du métal cobalt {{fchim|Co}} <sub>solide</sub> et du gaz dioxyde de carbone.\\n[[Fichier:Cobalt metal pieces.jpg|vignette|Pièce de métal cobalt, faces globuleuses obtenues par dépôt cathodique, face corrodée plus jaunâtre]]\\nLe grillage des minerais sulfurés ou arséniés conduit à des oxydes, qui sont réduits par le charbon ou le gaz hydrogène, pour obtenir du métal cobalt impur. Il existe surtout des procédés d'[[extraction du cobalt]] lié à la métallurgie extractive du cuivre. Le procédé d'affinage du cobalt par électrolyse est aussi utilisé, à partir d'hydroxydes, d'oxyhydroxydes ou de sulfates de cobalt.\\n\\n=== Alliages à base de cobalt ===\\nCes alliages sont nombreux, citons les aciers spéciaux au cobalt, par exemple [[acier rapide]] au Co et molybdène Mo ou acier au Co et tungstène W, ou encore au Cr avec Co, Mo et V tel que l'acier martensitique [[N690Co]], pour outil de coupe très rapide à températures élevées, ainsi que les multiples superalliages en passant par les aimants permanents à champ intense du type AlNiCo ou alliages dans lesquels entrent 66 à 12 % d'aluminium, 28 à 14 % de nickel, 35 à 5 % de cobalt, 6 à 0 % de cuivre ou 8 à 0 % de [[titane]]. Les [[Aimant samarium-cobalt|alliages de cobalt au samarium]] du type {{formule chimique|Sm|0,95|Co|0,05}} figurent parmi les meilleurs aimants permanents.\\n\\nIl existe également de nombreux outils de coupe (fraises, forets{{etc.}}) HSS avec adjonction de cobalt. Ces outils sont plus résistants à l'usure et adaptés à l'usinage des matériaux durs tels que le titane. Les outils HSS-CO (M35) contiennent 5 % de cobalt tandis que les outils HSS-CO8 (M42) contiennent 8 % de cobalt.\\n\\nLe cobalt est rendu malléable par alliage avec le magnésium. Il est rendu ductile par alliage avec le cuivre. Il améliore la dureté du nickel. La réalisation de revêtement par alliage nickel cobalt à 30 % de Co est possible par dépôt d'électrolyse, en présence d'additifs spécifiques à {{tmp|50|°C}} à pH entre 3,5 et 5 et en maintenant environ 6,5 fois plus d'ions nickel que d'ions cobalteux. La présence d'ions cobalt dans les bains de nickel joue aussi un rôle « brillanteur », conférant aux pièces traitées un bel aspect. La tenue à la corrosion et la résistance à l'usure de ce revêtement sont ''grosso modo'' équivalentes à un revêtement métallique de « chrome dur », à partir de [[chrome]] (VI)<ref>Robert Lévêque, ''Traitements et revêtements de surface des métaux'', édition Dunod, 2013, 472{{nb p.}} {{ISBN|9782100599370}}, en particulier {{chap.}}10 sur les revêtements obtenus en voie liquide, {{p.}}178.</ref>.\\n[[Fichier:TEM; cobalt iron alloy (6436372317).jpg|vignette|Alliage FeCo, esquisse de distinction des deux phases majoritaires Fe et Co.]]\\nLes aciers au cobalt sont très solides et résistent à hautes températures. Ils peuvent être recherchés pour leurs propriétés magnétiques. Ainsi les aciers à 72 % de fer, 17 % de cobalt, 8 % de tungstène, 2,5 % de chrome et 0,75 % de Cs sont des aimants permanents à champs intenses de l'ordre de 5000 à 10000 gauss.\\n\\nLe cobalt est un métal relativement léger et dur, résistant à la rayure, prenant par polissage une brillance argentée et pour ces raisons, il est apprécié par les bijoutiers orfèvres et joailliers<ref group=alpha>Beaucoup de bagues sont néanmoins réalisées avec du cobalt légèrement impur, contenant du nickel allergène.

Les alliages cobalt chrome sont encore plus résistants à l'usure, tout en perdant les propriétés ferromagnétiques.\\n\\nCitons encore des alliages ferreux, les FeNiCo, déclinés en [[Fernico]] ou en [[Kovar]], le Permendur comportant 58 % de fer, 40 % de cobalt, 2 % de vanadium pour les électroaimants ou le Comol à 71 % de fer, 17 % de molybdène et à 12 % de cobalt pour fabriquer des aimants permanents à champ de moyenne intensité. L'alliage modèle FeNiCo {{formule chimique|Fe|0,53|Ni|0,29|Co|0,18}} présente un coefficient de dilatation très proche du verre des ampoules électriques classiques, ils étaient utilisés pour le passage des fils dans ces ampoules.\\n\\nLes superalliages réfractaires peuvent des « fontes » HS-31 à 54 % de cobalt, 25,5 % de cuivre, 10,5 % de nickel, 7,5 % de tungstène, et seulement 2 % de fer et 0,5 % de carbone. Les stellites sont d'autres superalliages très durs, résistants à l'usure par les agents chimiques, soient comportant 66 % de cobalt, 26 % de chrome, 6 % de tungstène et 2 % de carbone. L'alliage « vitellium » conçu pour les prothèses et l'ostéosynthèse comporte 65 % de cobalt, 30 % de chrome et 5 % de molybdène.\\n\\nVoir aussi les [[Alliage cobalt-platine|alliages de platine et cobalt]].\\n\\n== Chimie, corps composés et complexes du cobalt ==\\nLa chimie du cobalt fait place aux multiples états d'oxydations -I, 0, I, '''II''', '''III''', IV et V.

Cependant comme le potentiel standard d'oxydation du cobalt est supérieur à celui du couple Ce(IV)/Ce(III), on ne peut pas titrer directement une solution de Co(II). Pour abaisser le potentiel standard, on stabilise le Co(III) en le complexant par exemple en utilisant l'[[1,10-phénantroline|ortophénantroline]].

C'est à leur sujet que la célèbre compétition avec [[Sophus Mads Jørgensen|Jorgensen]] intervint, aux dépens de ce dernier. Aujourd'hui les composés de coordination sont décrits par la théorie du champ des coordinats, qui allie les propriétés magnétiques, spectroscopiques, structurales et thermodynamiques.\\n\\nBien qu'il existe des composés de coordination du cobalt à tous les degrés d'oxydation entre (-I) et (+V), la plupart des complexes sont aux degrés II et III. De par son nombre impair d'électrons, les complexes mononucléaires au degré (II) sont forcément paramagnétiques.\\n\\n==== Géométrie des complexes ====\\nLes ligands anioniques monodentates (Cl<sup>−</sup>, Br<sup>−</sup>, I<sup>−</sup>, SCN<sup>−</sup>, N<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) : les complexes sont souvent tétraédriques, donc bleus ; c'est aussi le cas avec les complexes bidentates encombrés : salicylate, bétadicétonate substitué.\\n\\nQuelques ligands donnent des complexes plan-carré, comme le diméthylglyoximate (ligand d'importance analytique), les porphyrines, les bases de Schiff, etc.\\n\\nDe nombreux ligands donnent des complexes octaédriques (eau, [[ammoniac]], [[éthylènediamine]], cyanure...).\\n<gallery caption=\"Différentes géométries de complexes du cobalt\">\\nFichier:Salcomine.png|Complexe plan-carré\\nFichier:Trans-dichlorotetraamminecobalt(III).png|Complexe octaédrique trans\\nFichier:Cis-dichlorotetraamminecobalt(III).png|Complexe octaédriques cis\\n</gallery>\\n\\n==== Spectroscopie des complexes ====\\n[[Fichier:FOrgel2.GIF|thumb|Diagramme d'orgel pour un ion d7]]\\n[[Fichier:D7 Tanabe-Sugano diagram.png|thumb|Diagramme de Tanabe-Sugano pour un ion d7]]\\nLes solutions aqueuses de cobalt sont rose pâle. Dans le visible, trois bandes apparaissent sur le spectre :\\n* {{unité|8000|cm|-1}} ; ε = 1,3 ; <sup>4</sup>T<sub>{{unité|1|g}}</sub>(F) → <sup>4</sup>T<sub>{{unité|2|g}}</sub>(F) ;\\n* {{unité|19000|cm|-1}} ; ε = 4,8 ; <sup>4</sup>T<sub>{{unité|1|g}}</sub>(F) → <sup>4</sup>A<sub>{{unité|2|g}}</sub>(F) ;\\n* {{unité|21000|cm|-1}} ; ε = 2,1 ; <sup>4</sup>T<sub>{{unité|1|g}}</sub>(F) → <sup>4</sup>T<sub>{{unité|1|g}}</sub>(P)<ref>Figgis B.N. (1966). Introduction to Ligand Fields. Ed. Interscience Publishers, John Willey & Son, p.223.</ref>.\\n\\nLes coefficients d'absorbance ε sont faibles, traduisant des transitions interdites de symétrie (transition entre niveaux ''d'').\\n\\nCes données s'interprètent à l'aide du diagramme d'Orgel ou du [[diagramme de Tanabe-Sugano]].\\n\\nLes différents niveaux du diagramme d'Orgel ci-contre sont issus du terme <sup>4</sup>F (fondamental de l'ion libre Co<sup>2+</sup> ou de son premier niveau excité <sup>4</sup>P). Ce sont donc tous des quadruplets de spin entre lesquels les transitions électroniques sont permises (de spin, elle reste interdite de symétrie).\\n\\nQue ce soient des complexes tétraédriques ou octaédriques, tous sont censés présenter trois bandes d'absorption dans la gamme d'énergie UV-visible. Dans les faits, la transition de plus haute énergie est l'élément le plus caractéristique du spectre. C'est donc <sup>4</sup>A<sub>2</sub> → <sup>4</sup>T<sub>1</sub>(P) pour les complexes tétraédriques, et <sup>4</sup>T<sub>{{unité|1|g}}</sub>(F) → <sup>4</sup>T<sub>{{unité|1|g}}</sub>(P) pour les complexes octaédriques. L'enveloppe des bandes de ces transitions est généralement compliquée par la présence, dans la même gamme d'énergies, de transitions interdites de spin, mais dont l'intensité est renforcée par l'existence d'un couplage spin orbite<ref>Cotton A. & Wilkinson G. (1972). ''Advanced inorganic chemistry''. {{3e}} éd, éd. Willey interscience. p.880.</ref>.\\n\\nLes autres transitions sont dans le proche infrarouge. Elles s'analysent bien avec le [[diagramme de Tanabe-Sugano]]. Pour {{Fchim|Co(H|2|O)|6}}<sup>2+</sup>, ''B'' = {{Unité|980|cm|-1}} et Δ<sub>o</sub> = {{unité|9300|cm|-1}}. La valeur de ''B'' est égale à 80 % de la valeur ''B''* = {{unité|1120|cm|-1}} de l'ion libre Co<sup>2+</sup>.\\n\\n==== Magnétisme ====\\n===== Cas du cobalt(II) =====\\nLes complexes octaédriques à bas champ et tétraédriques du cobalt(II) diffèrent dans leurs propriétés magnétiques à cause de la contribution du moment orbital non nul dans le cas octaédrique, puisque le fondamental est un triplet d'orbital (terme T), alors que le fondamental des complexes tétraédriques est un singulet d'orbital (terme A).\\n\\nLe moment magnétique pour les complexes de niveau fondamental <sup>4</sup>T<sub>{{unité|1|g}}</sub>(F) est généralement entre 4,7 et 5,2 M.B., alors qu'il devrait être de 3,89 si la seule contribution du spin était présente.\\n\\nDans le cas des complexes tétraédriques, la situation est compliquée pour une autre raison. Bien que le fondamental soit un singulet d'orbitale (terme A), une contribution orbitalaire intervient aussi, mais indirectement, par l'intermédiaire du premier niveau excité <sup>4</sup>T<sub>2</sub>. Ainsi, les moments magnétiques des tétrahalogénocobaltates(II) sont :\\n* CoCl<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> : 4,59 M.B. ;\\n* CoBr<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> : 4,69 M.B. ;\\n* CoI<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> : 4,77 M.B.\\n\\nPeu de complexes octaédriques à haut champ ont été étudiés.\\n\\n===== Cas du cobalt(III) =====\\nÀ l'exception de quelques rares complexes comme CoF<sub>6</sub><sup>3−</sup>, les très nombreux complexes octaédriques du cobalt(III) sont des complexes à bas spin, et sont donc paramagnétiques. Leurs 6 électrons remplissent le niveau électronique t<sub>{{unité|2|g}}</sub> en s'appariant, et le terme fondamental est <sup>1</sup>A<sub>{{unité|1|g}}</sub>.\\n\\n=== Chimie organométallique ===\\nDe nombreux composés organométalliques du cobalt ont été préparés. Le plus célèbre d'entre eux, la vitamine B12, est présente dans la nature et est détaillée dans la section bioinorganique plus loin.\\n\\n==== Composés carbonyles ====\\nLe cobalt étant dans la {{9e|colonne}}, il possède, au degré d'oxydation zéro, un nombre impair d'électrons. Il ne peut donc satisfaire la règle des 18 électrons (qui s'applique bien pour les composés carbonylés) qu'en créant au moins une liaison cobalt-cobalt. C'est le cas de {{Fchim|Co|2|(CO)|8}}, {{Fchim|Co|4|(CO)|12}} ou {{Fchim|Co|6|(CO)|16}} qui peuvent être formés. Les ponts entre cobalts existent sous plusieurs structures géométriques en équilibre, par exemple, pour le composé dinucléaire {{Fchim|Co|2|(CO)|8}}.\\n[[Fichier:CobaltCarbonyl.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Équilibre entre deux formes pontées de l'octacarbonyledicobalt]]{{clr}}\\n\\n[[Fichier:HCo(CO)4-3D-balls.png|thumb|Modèle moléculaire du tétracarbonylhydrogénocobalt(-I)]]\\nLa réduction de {{Fchim|Co|2|(CO)|8}} par un amalgame de sodium dans le benzène conduit à {{Fchim|Co(CO)|4}}<sup>−</sup>, qui est un cobalt au degré d'oxydation (-I). En milieu acide, celui-ci donne l'hydrure jaune pâle {{Fchim|HCo(CO)|4}}. Dans des conditions plus drastiques, il est même possible de former un cobalt au degré d'oxydation (-III). Les éléments chimiques de la même colonne (rhodium et iridium) se comportent de la même façon.\\n\\nLes composés cobalt-carbonyles possèdent des applications industrielles puisqu'ils constituent le catalyseur des réactions d'[[hydroformylation]].\\n{{clr}}\\n\\n==== Composés cyclopentadiényles ====\\n\\n[[Fichier:Cobaltocene 200.svg|thumb|100px|Cobaltocène et sa structure [[Composé sandwich|sandwich]]]]\\nLe [[cobaltocène]] {{Fchim|Co(II)(C|5|H|5|)|2}} est un composé violet sombre, sensible à l'air, homologue du [[ferrocène]]. Il est préparé à partir de [[cyclopentadiénure de sodium]] et de [[chlorure de cobalt(II)|CoCl<sub>2</sub>]]. Il est stable (à l'abri de l'air) jusqu'à {{tmp|250|°C}}, mais sa grande réactivité par rapport à son homologue ferreux vient du fait qu'il possède 19 électrons dans sa [[sphère de coordination]]. Son nombre impair d'électrons lui confère une propriété [[paramagnétique]] avec un [[moment magnétique]] de 1,76 M.B., en conformité avec la formule du spin seul. Il s'oxyde assez facilement en ion cobalticinium, de couleur jaune : {{Fchim|Co(III)(C|5|H|5|)|2}}<sup>+</sup>. Ce dernier résiste à une autre oxydation, il est même stable dans l'[[acide nitrique]] concentré.\\n\\nIl existe aussi de nombreux [[composés semi-sandwich]] du cobalt de formule {{Fchim|Co(II)(C|5|H|5|)L|2}}, L étant un ligand [[phosphine]], carbonyle, etc.\\n\\n=== Vitamine B12 ou l'ion cobalt en chimie bio-inorganique ===\\nLe principal composé biologique du cobalt est la [[vitamine]] B<sub>12</sub>. Celle-ci fut extraite pour la première fois depuis des résidus de foie. Elle a été trouvée responsable de l'efficacité des traitements au fer, contre l'[[anémie]], qui étaient d'autant plus efficaces qu'ils contenaient des impuretés à base de colbalt<ref>Greenwook N.N., & Earnshaw A. (1997). Chemistry of the element. Ed Elsevier p.1138.</ref>.\\n[[Fichier:Cyanocobalamin.gif|gauche|vignette|Structure animée de la cyanocobalamine]]\\nLa vitamine B<sub>12</sub> est un [[Composé organométallique|complexe organométallique]] du cobalt. L'ion cobalt y est au centre d'un noyau [[porphyrine]]. Une telle situation ressemble à celle du fer dans l'[[hémoglobine]]. En plus des 4 atomes d'azote du noyau porphyrine, le cobalt est entouré d'un atome d'azote appartenant à un résidu [[imidazole]] d'une désoxy[[adénosine]]. La {{6e|position}} est occupée par un groupe [[alkyle]] lié au cobalt par une [[liaison sigma]]. Cela fait de cette vitamine le seul composé organométallique de cobalt existant dans la nature.\\n\\nLa [[Vitamine B12|vitamine B<sub>12</sub>]] peut être isolée sous forme de cyanocobalamine, dans laquelle un groupe CN<sup>−</sup> remplace la désoxyadénosyl sur la sixième position de coordination. D'autres substitutions de ce sixième ligand peuvent être effectuées (CH3-, OH).\\n\\nL'incorporation du cobalt dans le noyau porphyrine donne à cet élément des propriétés rédox originales puisque trois formes existent suivant les conditions :\\n* Co(I), vitamine B<sub>12s</sub> sous sa forme bleu-vert ;\\n* Co(II), vitamine B<sub>12r</sub> sous sa forme marron ;\\n* Co(III)-OH, [[hydroxocobalamine]] violette.\\n\\n<gallery caption=\"Différentes formes de la vitamine B12\">\\nVitaminB12.png | Vitamine B12\\nHydroxocobalamin.svg | Hydroxocobalamine\\n</gallery>\\n\\nCes différents états d'oxydation sont accessibles naturellement. Des composés modèles contenant du cobalt(II) complexé par une [[base de Schiff]] peuvent reproduire ce comportement.\\n\\nLe rôle biochimique de la vitamine B<sub>12</sub> est de permettre l'[[isomérisation]] du type\\n[[Fichier:Isomérie par vitamine B12.gif|center|Isomérie par vitamine B12]]\\n\\nElle permet en particulier la production d'érythrocytes ou globules rouges.\\n\\n=== Analyse ===\\nLes composés minéraux de cobalt colorent en bleu les perles de phosphore. Les sels de cobalt sont oxydés en oxyde de cobalt, le [[borax]] corps dissolvant d'oxydes, une fois imprégné à chaud, donne des \"perles de verres bleues\" après chauffage au chalumeau.\\n\\nLe thiocyanate de potassium donne avec les ions cobalteux un complexe de cobalt de couleur bleu, déjà décrit ci-dessus. Les solutions neutres ou peu acides d'ions cobalteux donnent avec le composé α-nitroso β-naphtol un précipité rouge-vineux de cobalt (III) de formule {{formule chimique|Co<sup>III</sup>[C|10|H|6|(OH)(NO)]|3|}}, soluble dans les solutions basiques et les acides dilués. Elles réagissent aussi avec les ions mercurithiocyanates, laissant un précipité bleu caractéristique {{formule chimique|CoHg(SCN|4|)}}<ref group=alpha>La réaction-test est surtout plus sensible en présence d'ions zinc divalent, le précipité mixte {{formule chimique|CoHg(SCN|4|). ZnHg(SCN|4|}} plus abondant et toujours bleu.</ref>.\\n\\nL'analyse quantitative peut être conduite par précipitation d'oxyde de cobalt {{formule chimique|Co|3|O|4|}}. L'électrolyse est également une technique pour les sels de cobalt.\\n\\n== Utilisations ==\\nHistoriquement, le cobalt a été utilisé principalement en métallurgie (70 % du cobalt produit depuis 1920), dont 11 % pour  les aimants, le second secteur dominant est la chimie (20 %) dont la pétrochimie (14 %). En 2006, environ 33 % de la production est utilisée pour les [[superalliage]]s (22 %) et les alliages durs (11 %).\\n\\n=== Cobalt dans les batteries ===\\nLa fabrication d'[[Accumulateur électrique|accumulateurs]], secteur en pleine évolution à partir de 1995 devient prédominant au début de la décennie 2010, avant de décliner à la fin de cette même décennie. Avec la demande pour les batteries de l'industrie automobile électrique, les prix du cobalt ont culminé en 2017 (30 $/livre) avant de chuter de moitié en 2019 avec l'abandon progressif dans la fabrication des batteries. En 2017, la production de batteries a représenté près de 50 % de la consommation de cobalt, alors que les [[superalliage]]s en représentaient 18 % et les alliages durs 8 %<ref>{{Lien web|langue=en|titre=Benchmark launches cobalt industry's first ever battery metal price|url=https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/benchmark-launches-cobalt-industrys-first-ever-battery-metal-price-first-assessment-at-97000-tonne/|site=Benchmark Minerals|date=9 avril 2018}}</ref>.\\n\\nL'utilisation du cobalt dans les accumulateurs du type [[accumulateur lithium-ion|lithium-ion]], dont une des deux électrodes est constituée de [[Dioxyde de cobalt et de lithium|LiCoO<sub>2</sub>]], a connu une croissance rapide jusqu'en 2019.

Présents dans divers matériaux semi-conducteurs, ces oxydes sont en outre utilisés comme pigments colorés des céramiques et des verres. Les hydroxydes de cobalt à structure lamellaire peuvent être utilisés dans les [[supercondensateur]]s.\\nLe carbonate de cobalt(II) est un pigment rouge pour céramiques.

Il fallait toutefois, pour les métallurgistes prudents, que les poussières fines de métal cobalt soient inférieures à {{unité|0.5|mg/m3}}. L'inhalation de ces poussières provoque en effet des troubles pulmonaires et le contact avec la [[peau]] provoque des [[Irritation de la peau|irritation]]s.

À des doses plus élevées, il est {{Citation|hautement toxique}}<ref name=ToxicologieCobalt2012/>. Les tests faits ''in vitro'' avec des ions cobalt sur des cellules de mammifères montrent qu'il est [[cytotoxique]] et induit l'[[apoptose]] et la [[nécrose]] cellulaire à des [[Concentration (chimie)|concentration]]s plus élevées que celle induisant une réponse inflammatoire<ref name=ToxicologieCobalt2012/>.\\n<br>L'ingestion de chlorure de cobalt (II) provoque aussi rapidement nausées et vomissement voire la mort.\\n<br>La [[dose létale]] est facilement atteinte, surtout chez l'enfant.

Les preuves de cancérogénicité du cobalt métallique et du sulfate de cobalt sont considérées comme suffisantes chez l'animal de laboratoire, mais encore jugées insuffisantes chez l'humain<ref name=ToxicologieCobalt2012/>.\\n\\n==== Métabolisme ====\\nIl est encore incomplètement cerné, mais on comprend mieux ses liens avec la carence en oxygène ([[hypoxie]]) dans les cellules animales : le Cobalt sous forme d'ion Co<sup>++</sup> stabilise les dégâts cellulaires dus à l'hypoxie et stimule la production d'[[érythropoïétine]] (EPO) et semble (par le même mécanisme) contribuer à coordonner et réguler d'autres réponses adaptatives à l'hypoxie, mais pour la plupart de ces réponses avec des effets cancérogènes potentiels (avérés dans le modèle animal)<ref name=ToxicologieCobalt2012/>.\\nUne hypothèse récemment proposée est que certains des effets toxiques de l'ion Co<sup>++</sup> sont dus à une interférence négative (à confirmer) avec la pompe à Ca<sup>++</sup> des cellules<ref name=ToxicologieCobalt2012/>.\\n\\n==== Cinétique corporelle ; rétention/excrétion ====\\nSa cinétique dans le corps (Co<sup>++</sup>) et son temps de séjour ont surtout été étudiés chez l'[[animal de laboratoire]] et un peu chez l'humain. <br />Il est principalement accumulé dans le foie, le rein, le pancréas et le cœur, et la teneur relative du squelette et du muscle squelettique augmentent lentement avec le temps après l'administration de cobalt<ref name=ToxicologieCobalt2012/>.\\n\\nChez l'humain, l'excrétion rénale d'abord rapide, diminue en quelques jours. Ensuite dans une seconde phase qui dure quelques semaines, elle est ralentie, et une partie du cobalt reste piégé dans les tissus durant plusieurs années<ref name=ToxicologieCobalt2012/> (notamment dans le derme en cas de tatouage).\\n\\nDans le sérum, l'ion Co<sup>++</sup> se lie à l'[[albumine]] outre des ions libres (5 à 12 % de la concentration totale de cobalt).\\nDans les globules rouges humains, il semble utiliser la même voie trans membranaire que le calcium, avec une absorption essentiellement irréversible quand il est effectivement engagé dans le [[cytosol]] (il n'est alors plus expulsé par la pompe à calcium)<ref name=ToxicologieCobalt2012/>.\\n\\n=== Imprégnation des populations humaines ===\\nElle semble presque systématique dans les pays riches (dont France) mais en des proportions encore mal connue, et elle varie vraisemblablement selon de nombreux paramètres (environnementaux et alimentaires notamment).\\n<br />En [[2018]] en France le « ''Volet [[périnatal]]'' » du ''programme national de [[biosurveillance]]'' a publié une évaluation de l'imprégnation des [[femme enceinte|femmes enceintes]] notamment par le cobalt (et par 12 autres métaux ou métalloïdes et quelques polluants organiques). Ce travail a été fait à l'occasion du suivi d'une cohorte de 4 145 femmes enceintes (« ''[[cohorte épidémiologique|Cohorte]] Elfe'' »). Cette cohorte comprenait des femmes ayant accouché en France en [[2011]] hors [[Corse]] et [[Territoire d'outre-mer (France)|TOM]])<ref name=EtudeF2011>[https://www.actu-environnement.com/media/pdf/news-30352-rapport-polluants-femme-enceinte-2.pdf : métaux et métalloïde] des recherches de la cohorte Elfe ; Décembre 2016 ; SANTÉ PUBLIQUE France / Imprégnation des femmes enceintes par les polluants de l’environnement en France en 2011].

Le [[dosage urinaire]] de 990 femmes enceintes arrivant à la maternité a confirmé l'omniprésence du Cobalt dans l'environnement<ref name=EtudeF2011/> ; il a été retrouvé dans 100 % des échantillons d’[[Analyse d'urine|urine analysées]]<ref name=EtudeF2011/> ([[moyenne géométrique]] : 0,85 μg/L avec comme taux de [[créatinine]] : 1,16 μg/g <ref name=EtudeF2011/> relativement similaires à ceux cités hors de France pour les femmes en fin de grossesse. - Ils sont cependant très supérieurs aux taux mesurés chez les femmes non-enceintes (en France notamment). La littérature cite cette différence, peut être explicable par des modifications métaboliques liées au manque de fer fréquent chez la femme enceinte<ref name=EtudeF2011/>. Dans l'étude française de 2018 dans le contexte périnatal, l'excrétion urinaire de cobalt est plus élevée en cas de tabagisme, et de consommation plus élevée de produits chocolatés et de thé, et elle tend par ailleurs à diminuer avec l’âge et la consommation de poisson. Les auteurs évoquent une possible corrélation avec le statut en fer de la femme (cf associations avec le thé et poisson) mais le bilan martial n'étant pas connu pour toutes les femmes de la cohorte Elfe cela reste une [[hypothèse]]<ref name=EtudeF2011/>.\\n\\nHormis pour les travailleurs ou personnes exposées à des sources industrielles ou naturelles importantes, 99 % du cobalt que nous absorbons proviendraient de la nourriture, plutôt que de l'eau ou de l'air<ref name=\"Page du Gvt. canadien sur le cobalt\"/>.\\n\\n=== Dissémination environnementale ===\\n[[Image:Cobalt OreUSGOV.jpg|thumb|Une des formes possibles de minerai de cobalt|264x264px]]\\n\\n==== Sources naturelles ====\\nSols, [[érosion]], [[volcan]]s, eau de mer et [[feux de forêt]].

Il a été utilisé dès l'Antiquité pour ses propriétés colorantes, notamment pour teindre le verre en bleu. Les mineurs saxons, confrontés à des minerais trompeurs riches en cobalt, les attribuaient à des esprits maléfiques appelés kobolds. Le terme \"cobalt\" vient de cette croyance et a évolué pour désigner le minerai puis l'élément chimique. Le cobalt a été utilisé pour ses propriétés chimiques, notamment pour la coloration bleue, et a retrouvé une utilité au XVIIe siècle avec la mode de la coloration en bleu.\n",

Elle a commencé ses activités commerciales par la production de chevaux mécaniques à bascule et de manèges pour enfants que l'on pouvait trouver dans un certain nombre de grands magasins à [[Yokohama]] et [[Nihonbashi]]. Namco a continué dans cette ligne de production durant les années 1960, puis l'a élargie avec l'ajout de produits inspirés de personnages issus de l'univers de [[Walt Disney]] en [[1966]].\\n\\nEn [[1971]], la dénomination ''Nakamura Manufacturing Ltd'', qui avait succédé à ''Nakamura Seisakusho'' en 1959, laisse place à la toute nouvelle appellation ''Namco''. Toutefois, ''Nakamura Manufacturing'' continuera de demeurer le nom officiel d'entreprise jusqu'en 1977. Dès [[1974]], Namco fait l'acquisition de la division japonaise d'[[Atari]], ce qui permet à Namco de s'introduire dans le marché du jeu vidéo. La filiale ''Namco Enterprises Asia Ltd.'' a été créée à [[Hong Kong]] et a été rapidement suivie par Namco America, Inc., basée en [[Californie]]. En [[1978]], Namco commercialise son premier jeu vidéo d'arcade appelé ''[[Gee Bee]]'', conçu par [[Toru Iwatani]]. Ce jeu aura également connu deux suites, ''[[Bomb Bee]]'' et ''[[Cutie Q]]'', proposées à la vente en [[1979]]. L'année [[1980]] a vu naître le plus célèbre jeu ''vidéo'' d'arcade de l'entreprise, le fameux ''[[Pac-Man]]'', également mis au point par Iwatani. Le personnage principal ''Pac-Man'' est maintenant devenu la mascotte officielle de la société Namco. Lorsque [[Nintendo]] commence à produire sa console [[Famicom]] au Japon (connue sous le nom de [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] dans le reste du monde), Namco développe des jeux pour ce support. Le premier d'entre eux fut ''[[Galaxian]]'', qui était sorti auparavant en arcade en 1979. En [[1984]], Namco lance le label Namcot pour la commercialisation de ses jeux [[MSX]] au Japon. C'est sous ce label, définitivement abandonné en 1995, que Namco publiera ses jeux sur toutes consoles et ordinateurs de maison dans son pays d'origine (MSX, Famicom, [[PC-Engine]], [[Super Nintendo|Super Famicom]] et [[Mega Drive]]) jusqu'à l'arrivée de la [[PlayStation]] de Sony. Ce label différenciait ainsi la section de développement des jeux de maison de celle des jeux d'arcade, qui avait gardé le nom Namco.\\n\\nNamco a été le premier fabricant à développer et à proposer une borne de jeu multijoueur, polyvalente et compétitive, ''[[Final Lap]]'', en [[1987]]. Ce jeu permettait à {{nombre|8|joueurs}} de s'affronter lorsque quatre bornes doubles étaient connectées ensemble à un réseau simple. En [[1988]], le capital de la société a dépassé {{nombre|5500|millions}} de [[yen]]. En [[1989]], un autre jeu de simulation de course appelé ''[[Winning Run]] ''a été commercialisé. La même année, la société devenant experte dans la simulation de conduite arrive à maturation avec le développement de l'''Eunos Roadster Driving Simulator'', une coentreprise lancée avec la société [[Mazda (automobiles)|Mazda Motor Corporation]], suivi d'un logiciel éducatif pour la sécurité routière mis au point avec la participation de [[Mitsubishi]]. D'autre part, dans une optique d'accès à tous au divertissement, Namco a commencé des activités avec les personnes âgées et handicapées par l'intermédiaire de ''Talking Aid'' en 1985.\\n\\nDans les [[années 1990]], Namco a commencé à vendre directement des jeux d'arcade aux [[États-Unis]] par l'intermédiaire de sa filiale Namco America. ''Sennichimae Plabo'' fut ouvert à [[Osaka|Ōsaka]], se fondant sur un nouveau concept de [[salle d'arcade]] à grande échelle, ainsi que ''Namco Wonder Eggs'', un parc à thème également ouvert à [[Tokyo|Tōkyō]]. D'autres parcs d'attractions furent créés, notamment ''Namco Wonder Park Sagamihara'' et ''Namco Wonder City''.\\n\\nEn [[1993]], Namco a fusionné ses opérations aux États-Unis représentées par ''Namco Operations, Inc.'', avec le tout nouvellement acquis ''[[Aladdin's Castle]], Inc.'' pour former ''Namco Cybertainment, Inc.'', ce qui porte l'entreprise à l'avant-garde du secteur, en tant que plus grande société d'arcade dans le monde. Au cours des années suivantes, Namco Cybertainment a acheté plusieurs autres entreprises travaillant dans le secteur de l'arcade, dans le but de renforcer le fonctionnement global de la branche arcade de la société Namco. Namco Cybertainment fonctionne maintenant dans le monde de l'arcade sous les noms de ''Time Out'', ''CyberStation'', ''Aladdin's Castle'', ''Diamond Jim's'', ''Space Port'', et ''Pocket Change''. Tout au long des [[années 2000]], Namco Cybertainment a continué de croître. La société est la seule à avoir des activités d'envergure nationale. Elle gère plus de 1000 sites dans quarante-huit [[États-Unis|états]], à [[Porto Rico]] et dans les [[îles Vierges]]. Chaque jour, les clients jouent à leurs jeux, plus des trois-quarts d'un million de fois dans des endroits que la société gère. Elle possède près de {{formatnum:30000}} jeux dans son inventaire, dépassant de loin tout autre distributeur. Namco Cybertainment possède le plus grand nombre des jeux les plus populaires fabriqués en Amérique du Nord, y compris les jeux de [[Sega]], [[Midway Games|Midway]], [[Konami]], ICE et de Namco America. Namco Cybertainment est généralement un gros client des fabricants de [[Système d'arcade|systèmes d'arcade]] en tout genre. Le {{date-|1 janvier 2012}}, Namco Cybertainment est renommé [[Namco Entertainment]].\\n[[Fichier:Pacmanchampion2.JPG|right|thumb|280px|Costume de PacMan]]\\n\\nToujours en 1993, ''[[Ridge Racer (jeu vidéo, 1993)|Ridge Racer]]'', une simulation de jeu de conduite intégrant des [[graphismes 3D]], est créée en arcade. Le jeu a été adapté plus tard pour la [[PlayStation]]. Un autre des plus célèbres jeux de la société, ''[[Tekken (jeu vidéo)|Tekken]]'', sort en [[1994]], avant d'être également rapidement porté sur la PlayStation. En [[1995]], le jeu ''[[Soul Edge]]'' (ou ''[[Soul Blade]]'' dans les régions utilisant [[Région PAL|PAL]]) a été commercialisé. Ce fut le second jeu de combat à proposer un environnement de combat en trois dimensions sur une [[console de jeu]] (''[[Battle Arena Toshinden]]'' fut le premier). Avec ses franchises ''Tekken'' et ''Soul'', Namco a dominé le marché du [[jeu de combat]] 3D. Ils ont également conçu ''[[Cybersled (arcade)|Cybersled]]'', un jeu de char de combat futuriste en 3D, qui a lui aussi été porté sur PlayStation. Enfin, certains jeux de tir ont été développés comme ''[[Point Blank (jeu vidéo)|Point Blank]]'' et ''[[Time Crisis (jeu vidéo)|Time Crisis]]''.\\n\\nEn [[1996]], Namco a pris un contrôle partagé dans la société [[cinématographique]] japonaise [[Nikkatsu]].\\n\\nLe {{date|7|septembre|2005}}, Nikkatsu est engloutie par l'énorme groupe [[Index Holding]].\\n\\nEn {{date-|septembre 2005}}, Namco fusionne avec [[Bandai]] pour devenir Namco Bandai Holdings, la {{3e|plus}} grande entité de jeux vidéo au [[Japon]]<ref>{{en}} [http://www.tekkenforces.com/namco-en.php Historique de la société Namco]</ref>. La société Namco originelle fait désormais partie du groupe Namco Bandai Games.\\n\\nEn janvier [[2006]], une filiale de Namco Bandai Holdings est créée aux États-Unis pour gérer le secteur des jeux pour téléphones mobiles en Amérique du Nord, sous le nom de ''Namco Networks America Inc.''. Namco est alors en mesure de porter un grand nombre de leurs jeux d'arcade à succès pour les téléphones portables. En {{date-|mars 2006}}, Namco Networks America a aussi ouvert un site de [[vente en ligne]], clubNAMCO.com qui propose des produits de [[merchandising]] officiel basé sur les jeux Namco.\\n\\nDepuis la prise de pouvoir de la holding, Namco a fusionné avec la section jeu vidéo de Bandai, puis ce nouveau groupe a été renommé [[Namco Bandai Games]] à la date du {{date|31|mars|2006}}.\\n\\nD'autres branches de Namco (les parcs à thème et les parcs d'exploration) ont été transférés vers une nouvelle filiale du groupe Namco Bandai Holdings et ont également changé de raison sociale.\\n\\n== Arcade ==\\nNamco demeure un des éditeurs phares de jeu vidéo d'arcade<ref>{{en}} [http://www.ripten.com/2007/10/31/top-ten-developers-2-namco/ Bref historique sur Namco]</ref>.

Elle est connue pour des titres célèbres comme \"Pac-Man\", \"Tekken\", \"Soul Calibur\", et \"Ace Combat\". En 1974, Namco s'est lancée dans le secteur du jeu vidéo et a fusionné avec Bandai en 2005 pour former Namco Bandai Holdings. Cette fusion a conduit à plusieurs changements de nom et de structure, notamment Namco Bandai Games en 2006, Bandai Namco Games en 2014, et finalement Bandai Namco Entertainment en 2015. Les sections divertissement, parcs à thèmes et parcs d'exploration de Namco ont été séparées et regroupées sous le nom de Namco Limited. Namco est un pilier mondial de l'industrie de l'arcade et continue d'être une entreprise influente dans le domaine du jeu vidéo.\n",

En appelant ce numéro, on peut écouter une conversation téléphonique qui est décrite d'un point de vue différent sur [http://www.uswiretap.com U.S. Wiretap.com].\\n\\nÉgalement, un T-shirt de la tournée contenait en lettres capitales un autre numéro : 1-310-295-1040<ref name=\"1800survivalism\">{{ Lien web|url=http://www.theninhotline.net/news/archives/backissue/07/2#1171506499|titre = 1-800-Survivalism (DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER, IT'S JUST A HEADLINE!!)|éditeur=theninhotline.net|date=14 février 2007|consulté le=16 février 2007 }}</ref>.

Ce bras est connu comme « La Présence ». La Présence est depuis un élément récurrent dans les supports entourant l'album, en particulier dans le trailer et la pochette de l'album.\\n<!-- Thought about starting a list of \"sightings\" for \"The Presence\" in this spot, as it seems to have become sort of a \"scavenger hunt.\" That, and the image is just downright spooky in my opinion. I'm not sure how to create indented line breaks for a \"sightings\" heading. Feel free (of course) if you've got that ability. Thanks! -->\\n\\nPar exemple, \"La Présence\" est repérable dans la vidéo tournée pour « [[Survivalism (song)|Survivalism]] ». Vers le milieu de cette vidéo, on voit un homme assis devant un ordinateur portable ; des photographies sont fixées sur le mur en arrière-plan. « La Présence » est visible sur la photo dans le coin gauche du haut de l'écran dans lequel on voit l'homme.\\n\\n=== Radio ===\\nLa chanson « ''{{lang|en|The Beginning of the End}}'' » fut jouée sur [[KROQ]] entre 1h et 2h du matin le {{date-|3 mars 2007}}. Bien que la piste ne fut pas officiellement « ''{{lang|en|leakée}}'' », un enregistrement du passage radio commença à circuler sur internet peu après.\\n\\n=== Diffusion ===\\nLe {{date-|4 avril 2007}}, la première version pirate complète et en haute-qualité de l'album fut disponible sur internet. Le même jour, probablement en réaction à cette fuite, le site officiel donne accès à un lecteur permettant l'écoute illimitée, gratuite, et en haute-qualité de l'album.\\n\\n== Thèmes ==\\nDans une interview pour ''[[Kerrang!]]'', Reznor déclara que ''Year Zero'' était un [[concept album]], bien que ne détaillant pas le concept lui-même, en disant que :<blockquote>\"J'essaie de ne pas donner trop de détails à ce propos, mais je vous dirai que c'est un concept album, une partie d'une chose bien plus grosse sur laquelle je travaille. Essentiellement, j'ai écrit la bande son d'un film qui n'existe pas.\"</blockquote>Le blog de Reznor indiqua en 2006 que l'album \"pourrait être sur la fin du monde\" et remarqua un \"changement de direction\" dans ce qui \"ne sonne pas comme ''With Teeth''<ref name=\"Spiral\" />.\" Cette année le merchandising de NIN en tournée contenait des références aux forces armées des États-Unis, qui \"reflétait les directions futures\" selon Reznor<ref name=\"Spiral\" />.\\nQuinze pistes étaient prévues pour l'album, que Reznor décrivait comme \"Hautement conceptuel. Plutôt bruyant. Putainement cool<ref name=\"Updates\" />.\" Il écrivit plus loin qu'il avait fini le nouvel album, qu'il allait devoir \"mener une bataille avec les gens dont le travail est de vendre le CD. La seule fois où ça n'est pas arrivé, c'était [pour] ''With Teeth''. Cette fois, néanmoins, [il] s'attendait à une lutte épique.

Il a été synthétisé pour la première fois en juillet 2004 au RIKEN près de Tokyo, et son identification a été validée par l'IUPAC en décembre 2015. Le nihonium est un transactinide radioactif, avec l'isotope le plus stable, le 286Nh, ayant une période radioactive de 19,6 secondes. Il est situé sous le thallium dans le tableau périodique et pourrait avoir des propriétés chimiques similaires à celles d'un métal pauvre. L'IUPAC a officiellement nommé l'élément en novembre 2016 en référence au Japon. L'élément a été initialement découvert par une équipe russo-américaine en août 2003, mais la synthèse japonaise a été confirmée comme première.\n",

Elle a eu lieu dans et autour de la ville [[Arabie saoudite|saoudienne]] de [[Ras al-Khafji|Khafji]], à partir du {{date|29 janvier}} jusqu'au {{date|1|février|1991}} et a marqué le point culminant de la campagne aérienne de la Coalition au [[Koweït]] et en [[République d'Irak (1968-2003)|Irak]], qui a débuté le {{date|17|janvier|1991}}.\\n\\nCette bataille est une démonstration de la puissance aérienne moderne, montrant que celle-ci peut parvenir à stopper et vaincre des opérations terrestres d'envergure, elle illustre ainsi le concept fondamental de la [[supériorité aérienne]]. Elle a également été un baptême du feu majeur pour les armées saoudienne et qatarienne. Bien que la capture de Khafji a servi à des fins de propagande pour le [[Irak baassiste|régime de Saddam Hussein]], sa reconquête ultérieure a fortement augmenté le moral des troupes de la Coalition.\\n\\n== Contexte historique ==\\n{{Article détaillé|Invasion du Koweït|Guerre du Golfe}}\\n[[Fichier:Khafji.jpg|vignette|gauche|La ville de [[Ras al-Khafji|Khafji]] avant la bataille.]]\\n[[Saddam Hussein]], dirigeant de l'[[Irak baassiste|Irak]], souhaitait attirer les forces de la Coalition dans des combats au sol, ces dernières menant une campagne aérienne contre l'[[Forces armées irakiennes|armée irakienne]] depuis le {{date|17|janvier|1991}}. Les défenses anti-aériennes et l'armée de l'air irakiennes ont été largement surpassées par l'aviation de la Coalition. Les tirs de [[Scud]] contre [[Israël]] et les raffineries pétrolières [[Arabie saoudite|saoudiennes]] devaient provoquer une intervention au sol par la Coalition. Dès lors, les forces irakiennes, stationnées au [[Koweït]], lancent une offensive sur [[Ras al-Khafji|Khafji]], ville saoudienne située près de la frontière avec le Koweït. La {{1re|division}} mécanisée ainsi que la {{3e|division}} blindée et la {{5e|division}} mécanisée dépendant du {{IIIe}} corps sous le commandement du général de division [[Salah Aboud Mahmoud]] avaient pour objectif de capturer la ville.\\n\\n== Déroulement de la bataille ==\\n[[Fichier:KnockedoutIraqiT62khafji.jpg|vignette|gauche|Un [[T-62]] irakien hors de combat après la bataille.]]\\nDès le {{date|29|janvier|1991-}}, la {{6e}} brigade blindées de l'[[armée irakienne]] de {{unité|2000|hommes}} équipée de [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] pénètre dans la ville, sans véritable défense, et l'occupe. Aussitôt, des unités du [[United States Marine Corps|Corps des Marines des États-Unis]] équipées entre autres de [[LAV-25]] engagent le combat. Elles bénéficient du puissant [[appui aérien rapproché]] des avions de la Coalition qui bloquent une bonne partie des unités irakiennes sur leur ligne de départ ainsi que par deux bataillons de la Garde nationale [[Arabie saoudite|saoudienne]] disposant de [[Cadillac Gage Commando|Commando V-150]] et deux compagnies de chars [[AMX-30]] [[Forces terrestres qatariennes|qatariennes]]. Trois des quatre forces opérationnelles de la {{5e}} division mécanisée, de la taille d'un bataillon, ont été repoussées par les Marines, la quatrième pénètre dans la ville et sera détruite. Le {{date-|30 janvier 1991}}, alors que la division franchissait la frontière pour l'attaque principale, la {{26e}} brigade blindée est piégée dans un champ de mines et subit de nombreux dégâts. Le général [[Salah Aboud Mahmoud]] arrête l'offensive, car il pense qu'il est impossible d'exécuter le plan complet.\\n\\nLa coalition reprend le contrôle de Khafji, qui est déclarée sécurisée le {{date|1|février|1991-}}.

Bereits Aššur-aḫḫe-iddina war unter Mithilfe Naqias entgegen der üblichen Rangfolge von [[Sîn-aḫḫe-eriba]] als Kronprinz von Assyrien ausgewählt worden. Noch als Kronprinz heiratete er [[Libbāli-šarrat]].\\n\\nDurch seinen Lehrer [[Balasi]] genoss Aššur-bāni-apli wie auch Sîn-aḫḫe-eriba und Aššur-aḫḫe-iddina eine sorgfältige literarische Erziehung.

Chr. von ''einem [[heuschrecken]]artigen Einfall [[barbar]]ischer Zerstörer, die das Land verwüsteten'' und verwendete für deren Anführer [[Dugdamme]] (nach griechischer Überlieferung ''Lygdamis'') das assyrische Schimpfwort ''[[Gutäer]]''. Bereits um 667 v. Chr. bat der [[Lydien|lydische]] König [[Gyges]] um assyrische Hilfe gegen die ''umherziehenden [[Iškuza]]ia''. Aššur-bāni-apli folgte dem Hilferuf nicht und vermerkte kurze Zeit später die Gefangennahme von Gyges. Im weiteren Verlauf muss Gyges die Rückeroberung gelungen sein, da zwischen 666 v. Chr. und 650 v. Chr. ein Sieg über die ''Iškuzaia'' vermeldet wird.\\n\\nOb Aššur-bāni-apli den Angriff der Iškuzaia vollständig abwehren konnte, bleibt strittig. Der [[Astrologe|Orakelpriester]] ''Akullanu'' titulierte um 657 v. Chr. in einer [[Keilschrift]]tafel die ''Iškuzaia'' als ''Kiššutu''. Diese Benennung wurde sonst im Zusammenhang mit assyrischen Königen gebraucht, was für eine kurzzeitige Herrschaft sprechen würde.\\n\\nNach dem Tod des Gyges im Jahr 644 v. Chr. bat sein Sohn und Nachfolger [[Ardys II.]] erneut um assyrische Hilfe. Ob diesmal dem Gesuch Folge geleistet wurde, konnte bislang nicht geklärt werden. Die schriftliche Überlieferung für Dugdamme endet um 642 v. Chr. mit seinem Tod in [[Kilikien]]. Sein Sohn und Nachfolger [[Sandakkurru]] (auch Lesung ''Sandakšatru'' möglich) wird in einer [[Hymne]] an [[Šamaš]] um 640 v. Chr. genannt, in der Aššur-bāni-apli einen endgültigen Sieg über die ''Iškuzaia'' erbittet; ein weiterer Beweis, dass die Bedrohung auch in den Jahren nach Dugdamme noch andauerte.\\n\\n=== Weiterer Verlauf ===\\nSein Bruder [[Šamaš-šuma-ukin]] wurde, wie von Aššur-aḫḫe-iddina festgesetzt, König von [[Babylon]]. Er rebellierte mit der Unterstützung der [[Aramäer (Volk)|Aramäer]], [[Elamiter]] und [[Araber]]. 647 v. Chr. unterwarf Aššur-bāni-apli nach vierjährigen Kämpfen Babylonien. Šamaš-šuma-ukin verbrannte in den Ruinen seines Palastes. Dieser Frevel gegen das religiöse Herz von Mesopotamien dürfte Aššur-bāni-apli aber letztlich die Herrschaft gekostet haben. Mit [[Urartu]] pflegte Aššur-bāni-apli freundschaftliche Beziehungen; auch mit den [[Skythen]] hielt er später Freundschaft. Nach einem Aufstand brachte er [[Mannäer|Manna]] wieder unter assyrische Kontrolle. Nach der Eroberung Elams, etwa 636 v. Chr. brechen die Nachrichten über seine Regierungszeit ab.\\n\\nDie von ihm angelegte große [[Tontafelsammlung des Assurbanipal|Bibliothek]] hat noch der modernen Assyriologie unschätzbare Dienste geleistet, da der Fund dieser Tontafelbücherei in Kujundschik, einem Teil des alten [[Ninive]], der [[Assyriologie]] die Grundlagen für ihren weiteren Ausbau lieferte.\\n\\nIn allen Städten Babyloniens wie Assyriens hat Aššur-bāni-apli eine reiche Bautätigkeit entfaltet. Am wichtigsten sind der Ausbau eines alten und die Errichtung eines neuen Palastes in Ninive. Den Griechen, denen er unter dem Namen Sardanapal bekannt wurde, galt er als das Urbild eines Schwelgers, was den geschichtlichen Tatsachen wenig entspricht.\\n\\n<gallery class=\"center\">\\nMilkau Eingang zu den 'Archive Chambers' im Palast des Assurbanipals 13-2.jpg|Archivkammern im Palast\\nMilkau Assurbanipal als hoher Priester 51-2.jpg|Aššur-bāni-apli als Bauherr mit Korb\\n</gallery>\\n\\n== Eponyme ==\\n1997 wurde der [[Asteroid]] [[(7208) Ashurbanipal]] nach ihm benannt.<ref>[http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/ECS/MPCArchive/1997/MPC_19971016.pdf Minor Planet Circ. 30800]</ref>\\n\\n== Siehe auch ==\\n* [[Bibliothek des Aššurbanipal]]\\n* [[Sardanapal]] (griechische Bezeichnung, meist mit Aššur-bāni-apli gleichgesetzt)\\n* [[Der Tod des Sardanapal]]\\n\\n== Literatur ==\\n* [[Albert Kirk Grayson]]: ''The Chronology of the Reign of Ashurbanipal.''

Er war der 83. assyrische König und Zeitgenosse des letzten Herrschers der 25. Dynastie Tanotamun und Psammetich I., dem Gründer der 26. Dynastie in Ägypten. Aššur-bāni-apli wurde von seinem Vater Asarhaddon zum designierten König ernannt, nachdem seine Großmutter Naqia ihre direkte Verwandtschaftslinie durchsetzen konnte. Er hinterließ eine bedeutende Bibliothek in Ninive, die didaktische, literarische, religiöse, heilkundliche und astronomische Texte umfasste. Seine Residenzen wurden mit prächtigen Reliefs geschmückt, die Kriegs-, Jagd- und Alltagsszenen aus dem Palastleben darstellten. Aššur-bāni-apli berichtete um 665 v. Chr. von einem heuschreckenartigen Einfall barbarischer Zerstörer, die das Land verwüsteten, und nannte deren Anführer Dugdamme. Er weigerte sich, dem Hilferuf des lydischen Königs Gyges gegen die umherziehenden Iškuzaia zu folgen, und vermerkte später die Gefangennahme von Gyges. Der Angriff der Iškuzaia konnte möglicherweise nicht vollständig abgewehrt werden, da der Orakelpriester Akullanu um 657 v. Chr. eine drohende Gefahr prophezeite.\n",

Seine Mutter Anna, Tochter des Medizinprofessors [[Abraham Kuhn]], war [[Judentum|jüdischer]] Abstammung. Er wuchs in Straßburg und [[Frankfurt am Main]] auf, besuchte von 1915 bis 1916 in Frankfurt das [[Goethe-Gymnasium (Frankfurt am Main)|Goethe-Gymnasium]], von 1918 bis 1921 die [[Odenwaldschule]] und dann bis 1924 wieder das Goethe-Gymnasium und studierte [[Physik]] in [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt am Main]] von 1924 bis 1926. Anschließend ging er für zweieinhalb Jahre nach [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München|München]] und arbeitete unter anderem bei [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], bei dem er im Juli 1928 [[Promotion (Doktor)|promoviert]] wurde. Seine [[Dissertation|Doktorarbeit]] beschäftigte sich mit der Theorie der [[Elektronenbeugung]], die bleibenden Wert für die Analyse von experimentellen Daten hat. Mit Sommerfeld veröffentlichte er 1933 auch ein Buch über die Elektronentheorie der Metalle, die heute noch Gültigkeit hat.\\n\\n[[Datei:Hans Bethe ID badge.png|mini|Hans Bethe <br />Foto des [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los-Alamos]]-Dienstausweises während des Zweiten Weltkriegs]]\\nVom Herbst des Jahres 1929 an bis Herbst 1933 war er wieder in München, ab Mai 1930 als [[Privatdozent]]. Bis zum Jahre 1933 erhielt Bethe Lehrpositionen in Frankfurt am Main und [[Universität Stuttgart|Stuttgart]] jeweils für ein Semester. In dieser Zeit unternahm er auch Reisen nach [[Cambridge]] im Herbst 1930 und nach [[Rom]] im Frühjahr 1931 und 1932, wo er mit [[Enrico Fermi]] zusammenarbeitete. Im Wintersemester 1932/33 vertrat er das Extraordinariat für Theoretische Physik an der [[Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen]]<ref>Uwe Dietrich Adam, Hochschule und Nationalsozialismus. Die Universität Tübingen im Dritten Reich, Tübingen 1977, S. 29, 36.</ref>. Diese Stelle verlor er mit der Machtübernahme der [[Nationalsozialismus|Nationalsozialisten]], weil seine Mutter Jüdin war. Bethe schrieb an seinen akademischen Lehrer Arnold Sommerfeld am 11. April 1933: „Sie werden wahrscheinlich nicht wissen, dass meine Mutter Jüdin ist: Ich bin also nach dem Beamtengesetz 'nicht arischer Abstammung' und folglich nicht würdig, Beamter des Deutschen Reiches zu sein. […] Ich muss also wohl oder übel die Konsequenzen ziehen und versuchen irgendwo im Ausland unterzukommen.“<ref>{{Internetquelle|url=http://www.schoah.org/shoah/stefan1.htm|autor=Stefan Wolff|titel=Das Jahr 1933: Vertreibung und Emigration in der Physik|hrsg=schoah.org|zugriff=2015-03-06|sprache=en}}</ref> Er emigrierte im Oktober 1933 nach [[Vereinigtes Königreich|Großbritannien]], wo er zeitweise die Position eines Dozenten an der [[University of Manchester|Universität Manchester]] in den Jahren 1933 und 1934 innehatte. Im Herbst 1934 war Bethe akademischer Lehrer an der [[University of Bristol|Universität Bristol]].\\n\\nIm Februar 1935 erhielt Bethe eine Einladung in die [[Vereinigte Staaten|USA]], wurde Assistenzprofessor an der [[Cornell University|Cornell-Universität]] in Ithaca und im Sommer 1937 [[Professor]]. Bis zu seinem Lebensende blieb er mit einigen Unterbrechungen dort. Im [[Zweiter Weltkrieg|Zweiten Weltkrieg]] ging er zuerst an das ''Radiation Laboratory'' am [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], um am [[Radar|Mikrowellenradar]] zu arbeiten. Ein Sommersemester lang war Bethe an der [[University of California]] in Berkeley auf Einladung von [[Robert Oppenheimer]]. Anschließend ging Bethe an das [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory]], wo er, von Oppenheimer berufen, als Leiter der Theoretischen Abteilung an der Entwicklung der ersten [[Kernwaffe|Atombombe]] mitwirkte. 1941 wurde Bethe Staatsbürger der USA.\\n\\nIm Jahre 1952 kehrte Bethe erneut für ein halbes Jahr nach Los Alamos zurück, um (widerstrebend, wie er im Rückblick sagte) an der [[Kernwaffentechnik#Wasserstoffbombe|Wasserstoffbombe]] mitzuarbeiten. Er war ein einflussreicher Regierungsberater, der sich ab den 1960er Jahren jedoch zunehmend für Abrüstung einsetzte. Vor dem [[Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]]-Untersuchungsausschuss 1954 stellte er sich im Gegensatz zu [[Edward Teller]] hinter seinen ehemaligen Chef aus Los Alamos.\\n\\nWeitere kurze Abwesenheiten von seiner Universität betrafen die [[Columbia University]], die [[University of Cambridge|Universität Cambridge]], das [[CERN]] und [[Kopenhagen]]. 1957 wurde Bethe ausländisches Mitglied der [[Royal Society]] of [[London]] sowie Mitglied der [[National Academy of Sciences]] in Washington, D. C. Im Jahre 1975 wurde Bethe emeritiert.\\n\\nIn den 1980er und 1990er Jahren führte er eine Kampagne zur friedlichen Nutzung der [[Kernenergie]] und machte sich auch allgemein Gedanken über alle Aspekte der Energieversorgung, so dass eine 1988 erschienene Biographie über ihn den Titel ''Prophet of Energy''<ref>{{Literatur |Autor=Jeremy Bernstein |Titel=Prophet der Energie, Hans Bethe |Verlag=S. Hirzel Verlag |Ort=Stuttgart |Datum=1988 |ISBN=978-3-7776-0442-8 |Online= |Abruf=}}</ref> trägt. Mit anderen US-amerikanischen Physikern wie [[Sidney Drell]] äußerte er sich in den 1980er Jahren kritisch zum [[Strategic Defense Initiative|SDI-Programm]], das er für leicht zu umgehen hielt. 1995 schrieb Bethe einen offenen Brief an seine Kollegen, in dem er sie aufforderte, Arbeiten an Nuklearwaffen einzustellen. 2004 unterschrieb er zusammen mit 47 anderen Nobelpreisträgern einen Brief, der [[John Kerry]] für die Wahl zum [[Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten|Präsidenten]] der USA unterstützte und vor einer Beschränkung der Freiheit der [[Forschung]] durch [[George W. Bush]] warnte.\\n\\nBethe starb im März 2005 in seinem Haus in Ithaca im Alter von 98 Jahren. Er war der letzte Überlebende aus einer großen Reihe von bedeutenden Physikern aus der Zeit Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts. Bethe hinterließ seine Frau Rose (* 1917 in [[München]], gest. 2019 in Ithaca), Tochter des Physikers [[Paul Peter Ewald]], seinen Sohn Henry und seine Tochter Monica.<ref>{{Internetquelle | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/07/science/hans-bethe-father-of-nuclear-astrophysics-dies-at-98.html|titel=Hans Bethe, Father of Nuclear Astrophysics, Dies at 98| autor= Wiliam J.

In den 1970er Jahren wandte er die gefundenen Zustandsgleichungen für Kernmaterie dann auch in der Untersuchung von [[Neutronenstern]]en an.\\n\\n1947 gab Hans Bethe die erste Erklärung der [[Lamb-Verschiebung]] der [[Spektrallinie]]n des [[Wasserstoff]]s in einer ersten groben nicht-relativistischen Näherung der [[Quantenelektrodynamik]], die zeigte, dass das Problem angreifbar war, und die bald darauf folgende relativistische Behandlung durch [[Richard Feynman]] und [[Julian Seymour Schwinger|Julian Schwinger]] motivierte.\\n\\n1951 beschrieb er mit Edwin Salpeter gebundene Zustände in der Quantenfeldtheorie mit der [[Bethe-Salpeter-Gleichung]], wobei er das Wasserstoffatom der QED, das [[Positronium]] (Elektron-Positron-Paar) und den einfachsten Kern, das [[Deuteron]] (aus Proton und Neutron), im Auge hatte.\\n\\nSeinen Nobelpreis bekam er nicht zuletzt für eine Arbeit zur Energieerzeugung in Sternen aus dem Jahr 1939:<ref>{{Literatur |Autor=H.

Ab den 1970er Jahren wandte er sich verstärkt der [[Astrophysik]] zu und nutzte seine umfangreichen physikalischen Kenntnisse z.&nbsp;B. in der Kernphysik und der Theorie der [[Stoßwelle]]n – die er schon in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] bei der Untersuchung des Implosionsmechanismus einer Atombombe erworben hatte – zur Untersuchung der Theorie der [[Supernova]]-Explosionen (vor der Explosion fällt der Stern in sich zusammen). Sein Interesse verstärkte sich, als die Theorie an der [[SN 1987A|Supernova 1987A]] überprüft werden konnte. In einem einflussreichen Artikel setzte er die Erklärung des „solar neutrino puzzles“ durch russische Physiker ([[Neutrinooszillation|MSW-Effekt]]) durch.<ref>{{Literatur |Autor=H. A.

Beispielsweise meinte er 1935 mit [[Rudolf Peierls]] bewiesen zu haben, dass Neutrinos nie beobachtbar wären, oder er gab 1937 eine obere Grenze für die Beschleunigung mit [[Zyklotron]]en an, die aber durch die Erfindung frequenzmodulierter Ringbeschleuniger ([[Synchrotron]]) schon 1945 ([[Edwin Mattison McMillan|Edwin McMillan]], [[Wladimir Iossifowitsch Weksler|Weksler]]) überholt war.

Er promovierte 1928 bei Arnold Sommerfeld und arbeitete in verschiedenen Universitäten in Deutschland, bevor er aufgrund seiner jüdischen Abstammung durch die nationalsozialistische Regierung vertrieben wurde. Bethe emigrierte 1933 nach Großbritannien und später in die USA, wo er an der Cornell-Universität arbeitete. Während des Zweiten Weltkriegs war er am Radarprojekt beteiligt und lehrte später in Berkeley. Bethe verstarb 2005 in Ithaca, New York.\n",

NAMCO''' ([[Japanische Schrift|jap.]] {{lang|ja-Hani|株式会社ナムコ}}, ''[[Kabushiki-gaisha]] Namuko'', von '''''N'''akamura '''A'''musement Machine '''M'''anufacturing '''Co'''mpany'') ist ein [[japan]]isches Unterhaltungsunternehmen, das als Entwickler von Videospielen bekannt geworden ist. Zu den bekanntesten Spielen gehören „[[Pac-Man]]“, die „[[Tekken]]“-, „[[Soul Calibur]]“-/„[[Soul Blade]]“- und die „[[Ridge Racer]]“-Reihe.\\n\\nAm 31. März 2006 wurden von dem alten Namco, dessen Rechtsnachfolger heute [[Bandai Namco Holdings]] ist, die Geschäftsbereiche Amusement und ''Shinki Kaihatsu Jigyō'' ({{lang|ja-Hani|新規開発事業部門}}, dt. etwa: „Entwicklung neuartiger Geschäftsfelder“) in ein neues Unternehmen ausgegliedert, das den Namen Namco übernahm.\\n\\n== Geschichte ==\\n=== „Altes“ Namco (1955–2005) ===\\n{{Infobox Unternehmen\\n| Name = Namco\\n| Logo = Namco logo.svg\\n| Unternehmensform = [[Kabushiki-gaisha]] (Aktiengesellschaft)\\n| Gründungsdatum = 1955\\n| Auflösungsdatum = 2005\\n| Sitz = [[Nerima]], [[Tokio]], [[Japan]]\\n| Leitung = \\n| Mitarbeiterzahl = \\n| Umsatz = \\n| Homepage = [http://www.namco.com/ www.namco.com]\\n}}\\n[[Masaya Nakamura]] gründete das Unternehmen 1955 in [[Tokio]] als Nakamura Manufacturing Ltd. Man begann mit der Produktion mechanischer [[Rodeo]]-[[Pferde]] und ähnlicher Kinder-Reit- und Fahr-[[Automat]]en, die in einigen Einkaufszentren in [[Yokohama]] und [[Nihonbashi]] installiert wurden. Man folgte dieser Produktionslinie über die 1960er und expandierte 1966, indem man nun auch Geräte in Form von [[Walt Disney|Walt-Disney]]-Charakteren herstellte.\\n\\nDer Firmenname wurde 1972 in Namco umgeändert, und 1974 erwarb man die japanische Division von [[Atari, Inc. (1972)|Atari]] und stieg so in das Geschäft der münzbasierenden Videospielautomaten ein. Namco Enterprises Asia Ltd. wurde in [[Hongkong]] gegründet, bald gefolgt von Namco America, Inc. in [[Kalifornien]]. 1980 erschien eines von Namcos bekanntesten Automatenspielen, ''[[Pac-Man]]''. Als [[Nintendo]] mit der Produktion der [[Famicom]]-Heimkonsole begann, startete Namco mit der Entwicklung von Spielen dafür, beginnend mit ''[[Galaxian]]'', welches 1979 in [[Spielhalle]]n vorgestellt worden war.\\n\\nIm Jahre 1981 erschien das Weltraumspiel ''[[Galaga]]''. Der mehrfarbige Sternenhintergrund vermittelte ein bis dahin unbekanntes, räumliches Bild. ''Galaga'' forderte seinen Spieler heraus, eine Anzahl von verschiedenen Weltrauminsekten, die aus verschiedenen Richtungen anflogen, zu eliminieren. Dabei waren die Kürze der einzelnen Levels und die Möglichkeit, durch ein entführtes und anschließend zurückgewonnenes Raumschiff die Feuerkapazität zu verdoppeln, sicherlich mit ein Grund, warum dieses Videospiel niemals langweilig wurde und immer wieder aufs Neue begeisterte.\\n\\nNamco war der erste Hersteller, der ein Mehrspieler-[[Arcade-Spiel]] mit zwei Kabinen auf den Markt brachte: ''[[Final Lap]]'' erschien 1987. Dieses Spiel erlaubte es bis zu acht Spielern, gegeneinander zu spielen, wenn vier Zwei-Spieler-Kabinen in einem einfachen Netzwerk verlinkt wurden. Um 1988 überschritt das Namcos Kapital 5,5 Milliarden [[Yen]]. 1988 erschien ein weiteres Rennspiel namens ''[[Winning Run]]''; im selben Jahr zeigte sich die Erfahrung der Firma mit Autofahrsimulationen mit der Entwicklung des Eunos Roadster Driving Simulator, einem Joint-Venture mit der [[Mazda]] Motor Corporation, gefolgt von einer Lernsoftware über Verkehrssicherheit, entwickelt mit [[Mitsubishi]].\\n\\nIn den 1990ern begann Namco mit dem direkten Verkauf münzbasierender Arcade-Automaten in den [[USA|Vereinigten Staaten]] über die Tochterfirma Namco America und dehnte den Markt auf [[Europa]] aus mit der Gründung von Namco Europe, Ltd. in [[London]]. Sennichimae Plabo wurde in [[Osaka]] eröffnet und bot ein neues Konzept breitgefächerter Arcade-Unterhaltung, und Namco Wonder Eggs, ein Themenpark, wurde in Tokio eröffnet. Zusätzliche Freizeitparks wurden eröffnet, darunter Namco Wonder Park Sagamihara und Namco Wonder City.\\n\\n1993 vereinigte Namco sein US-Arcade-Unternehmen, Namco Operations, Inc., mit dem neu erworbenen Aladdin’s Castle, Inc., um Namco Cybertainment, Incorporated zu gründen, was die Firma zur größten Arcade-Gesellschaft der Welt machte. In den folgenden Jahren kaufte Namco Cybertainment, Inc. (NCI) weitere Arcade-Unternehmen auf, was die Position weiter stärkte. NCI stellt heute Arcade-Automaten unter den Namen Time Out, CyberStation, Aladdin's Castle, Diamond Jim's, Space Port, und Pocket Change her.\\n\\nAußerdem erschien 1993 „[[Ridge Racer]]“, ein Fahrsimulationsspiel, in den Spielhallen, und bot 3D-[[Computergrafik|Grafik]]; das Spiel erschien später für die [[PlayStation|Sony Playstation]]. Ein anderes sehr berühmtes Spiel ist das [[Beat ’em up]] „[[Tekken]]“, welches 1994 erschien und ebenfalls bald auf die Playstation portiert wurde. Tochterfirmen in [[Deutschland]], [[Frankreich]], [[Spanien]] und [[Israel]] wurden gegründet, und bald begann man auch dort mit der Entwicklung von Arcade-Spielen.\\n\\nIm Frühjahr 2005 kündigten Namco und [[Bandai]] eine Zusammenlegung ihres operativen Geschäftes an, die am 29. September desselben Jahres in der Gründung der [[Namco Bandai Holdings]] mündete. Am 31. März 2006 ging die Spielesparte von Bandai in Namco auf und führte zur Gründung der [[Namco Bandai Games]].\\n\\n=== „Neues“ Namco (2006–) ===\\n{{Infobox Unternehmen\\n| Name = Namco\\n| Logo = Namco logo.svg\\n| Unternehmensform = [[Kabushiki-gaisha]] (Aktiengesellschaft)\\n| Gründungsdatum = 2006\\n| Sitz = [[Ōta (Tokio)|Ōta]], [[Tokio]], [[Japan]]\\n| Leitung = \\n| Mitarbeiterzahl = \\n| Umsatz = \\n| Homepage = [http://www.namco.co.jp/ www.namco.co.jp]\\n}}\\nGleichzeitig wurden die Geschäftsbereiche Amusement (Arcade-Automaten, ''Food Theme Parks'', Internet-Shops) und ''Shinki Kaihatsu Jigyō'' des früheren Namcos, wie der ''Rehabilitainment''-Bereich – ein Kofferwort aus [[Medizinische Rehabilitation|Rehabilitation]] und Entertainment – in eine neue Tochtergesellschaft der Bandai Namco Holdings überführt, die den Namen ''Namco'' übernahm.\\n\\n== Bekannte Spiele (Auswahl) ==\\n[[Datei:Keita Takahashi - 2005.jpg|mini|hochkant|Namco-Entwickler Keita Takahashi mit einer Figur aus Katamari Damacy]]\\n* [[Ace Combat]]\\n* [[Bosconian]]\\n* [[Dig Dug]]\\n* [[Final Lap]]\\n* [[Galaga]]\\n* [[Galaxian]]\\n* [[Katamari Damacy]]\\n* [[Klonoa]]\\n* [[Mappy]]\\n* [[Mirai Ninja]]\\n* [[Pac-Man]]\\n* [[Point Blank (Computerspiel)|Point Blank]]\\n* [[Pole Position (Computerspiel)|Pole Position]] 1 und 2\\n* [[Rally-X]]\\n* [[Ridge Racer]]\\n* [[Soul Blade]]\\n* [[Soul Calibur]]\\n* [[Tales of Phantasia|Tales of …]]\\n* [[Tekken]]\\n* [[Time Crisis]]\\n* [[Xenosaga]]\\n* [[Dragon Valor]]\\n\\n== Weblinks ==\\n{{Commonscat}}\\n* [http://www.namco.co.jp/ Offizielle Website] (japanisch)\\n\\n[[Kategorie:Spielesoftwareunternehmen (Japan)]]\\n[[Kategorie:Unternehmen (Nerima)]]\\n[[Kategorie:Unternehmen (Ōta, Tokio)]]\\n[[Kategorie:Unternehmensgründung 1955]]    https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namco  K.K. NAMCO ist ein japanisches Unterhaltungsunternehmen, bekannt für Videospiele wie Pac-Man, Tekken, Soul Calibur und Ridge Racer. Das Unternehmen wurde 1955 von Masaya Nakamura als Nakamura Manufacturing Ltd. gegründet und produzierte zunächst mechanische Reit- und Fahrautomaten. 1972 änderte es seinen Namen in Namco und betrat 1974 das Videospielgeschäft, nachdem es die japanische Atari-Abteilung erwarb. Bekannte Spiele wie Pac-Man und Galaga erschienen in den 1980er Jahren. 1987 brachte Namco das erste Mehrspieler-Arcade-Spiel Final Lap auf den Markt. In den 1990er Jahren expandierte das Unternehmen in die USA und Europa und betrieb auch Freizeitparks. 2006 spaltete das alte Namco seine Geschäftsbereiche in ein neues Unternehmen, das den Namen Namco übernahm. Heute ist Bandai Namco Holdings der Rechtsnachfolger des alten Namco.\n",

Es zählt zu den [[Übergangsmetalle]]n sowie den [[Metalle der Seltenen Erden|Seltenerdmetallen]], im [[Periodensystem]] steht es in der 5. [[Periode-5-Element|Periode]] sowie der 3. [[Nebengruppe]], bzw. der 3.&nbsp;[[Gruppe des Periodensystems|IUPAC-Gruppe]] oder [[Scandiumgruppe]]. Yttrium ist nach dem ersten Fundort, der [[Grube Ytterby]] bei [[Stockholm]], benannt, wie auch [[Ytterbium]], [[Terbium]] und [[Erbium]].\\n\\n== Geschichte ==\\nYttrium wurde 1794 von [[Johan Gadolin]] im [[Mineral]] [[Ytterbit]] entdeckt. 1824 stellte [[Friedrich Wöhler]] verunreinigtes Yttrium durch Reduktion von Yttriumchlorid mit Kalium her. Erst 1842 gelang [[Carl Gustav Mosander]] die Trennung des Yttriums von den Begleitelementen Erbium und Terbium.\\n\\n== Vorkommen ==\\nYttrium kommt in der Natur nicht im elementaren Zustand vor.\\nYttriumhaltige [[Mineral]]e (Yttererden) sind immer verschwistert mit anderen Seltenerdmetallen.\\nAuch in Uranerzen kann es enthalten sein.\\nKommerziell abbauwürdig sind [[Monazit]]sande, die bis zu 3 % Yttrium enthalten, sowie [[Bastnäsit]], der  0,2 % Yttrium enthält.\\nWeiterhin ist es der Hauptbestandteil des [[Xenotim]] (Y[PO<sub>4</sub>]).\\n\\nGroße Monazitvorkommen, die Anfang des 19.&nbsp;Jahrhunderts in Brasilien und Indien entdeckt und ausgebeutet wurden, machten diese beiden Länder zu den Hauptproduzenten von Yttriumerzen.\\nErst die Eröffnung der [[Mountain Pass Mine]] in Kalifornien, die bis in die 1990er Jahre große Mengen an Bastnäsit förderte, machte die [[Vereinigte Staaten|USA]] zum Hauptproduzenten von Yttrium, obwohl der dort abgebaute Bastnäsit nur wenig Yttrium enthält.\\nSeit der Schließung dieser Mine ist [[Volksrepublik China|China]] mit 60 % der größte Produzent für Seltene Erden.\\nDiese werden in einer Mine nahe [[Bayan Kuang]] gewonnen, deren [[Erz]] Xenotim enthält, und aus ionenabsorbierenden [[Tonminerale]]n, die vor allem im Süden Chinas abgebaut werden.\\n\\n== Gewinnung und Darstellung ==\\nDie Trennung der [[Metalle der Seltenen Erden|Seltenen Erden]] voneinander ist ein aufwändiger Schritt in der Produktion von Yttrium. [[Fraktionierte Kristallisation (Chemie)|Fraktionierte Kristallisation]] von Salzlösungen war zu Anfang die bevorzugte Methode, diese wurde schon früh für die Trennung der seltenen Erden im Labormaßstab verwendet. Erst die Einführung der [[Ionenchromatographie]] machte es möglich, die seltenen Erden im industriellen Maßstab zu trennen.\\n\\nDas aufkonzentrierte [[Yttriumoxid]] wird umgesetzt zum [[Fluoride|Fluorid]]. Die anschließende [[Reduktion (Chemie)|Reduktion]] zum [[Metalle|Metall]] erfolgt mit [[Calcium]] im [[Induktionsofen|Vakuuminduktionsofen]].\\n\\nDer [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] schätzte die Jahresproduktion für 2020 auf 8.000 bis 12.000&nbsp;t Yttriumgehalt. Der Abbau erfolgte großteils in China und Myanmar. In der Mountain Pass Mine in Kalifornien wird seit 1. Quartal 2018 wieder Yttriumerz abgebaut, nachdem die Mine im 4. Quartal 2015 stillgelegt worden war. Die globalen Reserven von Yttriumoxid werden auf mehr als 500.000 Tonnen geschätzt.<ref>[https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2022/mcs2022-yttrium.pdf U.S. Geological Survey, Mineral Commodity Summaries 2022: YTTRIUM].</ref> Der Preis für Yttriumoxid mit einer [[Stoffreinheit|Reinheit]] von 99,999 % stieg von 25–27&nbsp;[[US-Dollar|USD]] je kg im Jahre 2010 auf 136–141&nbsp;USD im Jahr 2011 und fiel bis 2013 wieder auf 23–27&nbsp;USD.<ref name=\"usgs\" /> Im August 2015 lag der Preis bei ca. 5,5&nbsp;USD je&nbsp;kg.<ref name=\"am\" />\\n\\n== Eigenschaften ==\\n[[Datei:Yttrium sublimed dendritic and 1cm3 cube.jpg|mini|links|Yttrium, im Hochvakuum sublimiert, hochrein]]\\n\\nYttrium ist an der [[Luft]] relativ beständig, dunkelt aber unter Licht. Bei Temperaturen oberhalb von 400&nbsp;[[Grad Celsius|°C]] können sich frische Schnittstellen entzünden. Fein verteiltes Yttrium ist relativ unbeständig.\\nYttrium hat einen niedrigen [[Einfangquerschnitt]] für [[Neutron]]en.\\n\\nIn seinen Verbindungen ist es meist dreiwertig. Es gibt jedoch auch Clusterverbindungen, in denen Yttrium Oxidationsstufen unter 3 annehmen kann.\\nYttrium zählt zu den [[Leichtmetalle]]n.\\n\\n== Isotope ==\\nEs sind insgesamt 32 [[Isotop]]e zwischen <sup>76</sup>Y und <sup>108</sup>Y sowie weitere 24 [[Kernisomer]]e bekannt. Von diesen ist nur <sup>89</sup>Y, aus dem auch natürliches Yttrium ausschließlich besteht, stabil. Es handelt sich damit bei Yttrium um eines von 22 [[Reinelement]]en.

Es gehört zur 13. Gruppe des Periodensystems und zur Borgruppe. Die Synthese erfolgte durch Beschuss von Americium mit Calcium in einem Teilchenbeschleuniger. Die erste Synthese wurde 2003 von amerikanischen und russischen Wissenschaftlern in Dubna durchgeführt. Weitere Nachweise erfolgten 2006 durch Schweizer Forscher und 2012 durch japanische Forscher, die das Isotop 278Nh herstellten. Die Synthese hat eine sehr niedrige Effizienz, sodass nur statistisch über Monate hinweg ein einzelnes Atom erzeugt werden kann. Nihonium ist radioaktiv und hat mehrere Isotope, darunter 283Nh und 284Nh.\n",

Januar durch alliiertes Dauerbombardement geschwächte) irakische Divisionen unerwartet US- und alliierte arabische Truppen über die kuwaitisch-saudische Südgrenze hinweg angegriffen hatten. Diese Angriffe wurden zurückgeschlagen, banden allerdings Kräfte. Dies nutzte die irakische 5. mechanisierte Division, um entlang der Golfküste gut zehn Kilometer tief in saudisches Territorium vorzustoßen und die Industriestadt [[Chafdschi]] ({{arS|الخفجي&lrm;|DMG=al-Ḫafǧī}}, gemäß englischer Transkription ''Khafji'') in [[Saudi-Arabien]] am Abend des 29. Januar einzunehmen. Nach US-Einschätzung wollte die irakische Seite damit einen [[Abnutzungskrieg]] auf dem Boden auslösen, nachdem sie in den Tagen zuvor zunehmend hilflos den alliierten Luftschlägen gegenüber gestanden hatte. Die Stadt selbst war bereits zuvor evakuiert worden, da sie in der Reichweite der Artillerie irakischer Besatzungstruppen in Kuwait lag.<ref>J. Travis Moger: ''The Gulf War at 30.''

Anschließend starteten zwei Bataillone der [[Saudi-arabische Nationalgarde|saudischen Nationalgarde]] und zwei Panzerkompanien der [[Streitkräfte Katars|katarischen Streitkräfte]] eine Offensive und vertrieben die [[Irakische Streitkräfte#Geschichte|irakischen Truppen]] in zweitägigen Gefechten aus Chafdschi. Saudi-Arabien setzte 40.000 [[Soldat]]en und Katar 2.000 Soldaten in der Bodenoffensive ein. Zwei katarische Kampfpanzer vom Typ [[AMX-30]] und mindestens sieben saudische Spähpanzer vom Typ [[M706|V-150]] wurden von den Irakern zerstört.\\n\\n[[Datei:An air-to-air front view of a AC-130 Hercules aircraft in-flight near Hurlburt Field DF-ST-89-00413.jpg|mini|links|AC-130H Spectre Gunship]]\\n\\nDie USA unterstützten die Offensive mit [[Artillerie]]feuer, teils von See aus, und Luftangriffen. Während der Schlacht um Chafdschi wurde eine [[Lockheed AC-130|Lockheed AC-130H Spectre Gunship]] von der irakischen Luftabwehr abgeschossen, als diese im Gegensatz zu ihrer Einsatzdoktrin bei Tageslicht eingesetzt wurde.

Januar bis zum 1. Februar 1991 statt. Die irakische 5. mechanisierte Division drang in Saudi-Arabien ein und eroberte die Stadt Chafdschi. Ziel war es, einen Bodenkrieg auszulösen. Die saudische und katarische Armee sowie die USA konterten mit Luft- und Artillerieangriffen. In zweitägigen Gefechten wurden die Iraker aus der Stadt vertrieben. Die Alliierten erlitten geringere Verluste als die Iraker und zwangen diese letztlich zum Rückzug. Diese Schlacht war der erste größere Infanteriekampf im Krieg und zeigte die Stärke der alliierten Luftwaffen und Artillerie. Der Einsatz eines AC-130H Spectre Gunships wurde durch die irakische Luftabwehr beendet. Die Schlacht endete mit einem Sieg der saudischen Verbündeten und dem Abzug der irakischen Truppen aus Saudi-Arabien. Die genauen Verluste beliefen sich auf bis zu 300 Tote und 400 Gefangene auf der irakischen Seite und 43 Tote und 52 Verwundete auf der seite der Alliierten. Es wurde auch berichtet, dass einige saudische und katarische Kampfpanzer zerstört wurden. Die Schlacht markierte einen wichtigen Wendepunkt im Krieg zugunsten der Alliierten. \\n\\n(Note: The original text has been translated into English for clarity.) \\n\\nThe Battle of Khafji was part of the Second Gulf War, taking place from January 29 to February 1, 1991. Iraqi forces captured the Saudi city of Khafji with the aim of instigating a ground war. Allied forces, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the US, countered with air and artillery attacks, eventually driving out the Iraqis after two days of fighting. This marked the first major infantry battle of the conflict, showcasing the effectiveness of allied airpower and artillery. An AC-130H Spectre Gunship was shot down by Iraqi air defense. The battle concluded with the allies victorious and Iraqi troops withdrawing from Saudi territory. Casualties were significantly\n",

==\\nベリリウムはおもに[[合金]]の硬化剤として利用され、その代表的なものに[[ベリリウム銅]]合金がある。また、非常に強い[[曲げ強さ]]、熱的安定性および[[熱伝導率]]の高さ、金属としては比較的低い密度などの物理的性質を利用して、高速[[航空機]]や[[ミサイル]]、[[宇宙船]]、[[通信衛星]]などの[[軍事産業]]や[[航空宇宙産業]]において構造部材として用いられる。ベリリウムは低密度かつ原子量が小さいため[[X線]]やその他[[電離放射線]]に対して透過性を示し、その特性を利用してX線装置や[[素粒子物理学|粒子物理学]]の試験における[[X線透過窓]]として用いられる。\\n\\nベリリウムの用途には、その物理的性質を利用したX線装置や構造材、鏡（ベリリウムミラー）、合金材料、音響材料としての用途、磁気的性質を利用した工具製造、電子物性を利用した電子材料、核的性質を利用した中性子源や、ベリリウム鉱石の外観の美しさを利用した宝石としての用途が挙げられる。この中には[[核兵器]]や[[ミサイル]]、[[射撃管制装置]]などの軍事的用途も含まれ、そのような分野に関する詳細な情報を入手することは難しい<ref>Petzow, Günter ''et al.'' \"Beryllium and Beryllium Compounds\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a04_011.pub2}}</ref>。また、ベリリウムの毒性により、過去に用いられていた蛍光材料としての用途はすでにほかの代替材料に置き換えられており、ベリリウム銅合金なども代替材料の開発が進められている。\\n\\n=== X線透過窓 ===\\n[[ファイル:Be foil square.jpg|thumb|right|鋼鉄製のケースに乗せられた四角いベリリウム箔。真空チャンバーと[[X線顕微鏡]]の間で「窓」として用いられる]]\\nベリリウムは原子番号が小さく電子の数が少ないため、[[X線]]に対する[[透過率 (光学)|透過率]]が非常に高い。そのため、X線源やビームライン、[[X線望遠鏡]]などの検出器用の窓に用いられる。この用途においては、X線像に不要な像が写り込むことを回避するためにベリリウムの純度と清潔さがもっとも要求される。また、X線探知機のX線放射窓としてもベリリウムの薄膜が用いられている。これは、ベリリウムのX線吸収率が非常に低いことによって、高強度の[[シンクロトロン放射光]]に典型的な低エネルギーX線に起因する熱の影響を最小限に留めることができるためである。さらに、[[シンクロトロン]]による放射線試験のための真空気密窓およびビームチューブの素材にはベリリウムのみが用いられている。ほかにも、[[エネルギー分散型X線分析]]などのさまざまなX線を利用した分析機器においては、ベリリウム製のサンプルホルダーが常用される。これは、ベリリウムから発生する[[特性X線]]や[[蛍光X線]]の有するエネルギーが100&nbsp;eV以下と分析試料由来のX線と比較して非常に低く、試料の分析データに影響を与えないためである<ref

LIMITED}}）は、かつての[[日本]]の[[ゲーム会社一覧|ゲームメーカー]]、[[ゲームセンター|アミューズメント施設]]運営企業。現在の[[バンダイナムコエンターテインメント]]の[[権利能力|法人格]]上の前身である。\\n\\n1955年に有限会社中村製作所として設立され、1977年に株式会社ナムコに社名変更し、1980年代には『[[パックマン]]』など数々の名作ゲームを生み出した。2005年に[[バンダイ]]と経営統合して持株会社[[バンダイナムコホールディングス]]の子会社となり、2006年3月31日に組織再編によりバンダイのゲーム部門を統合して株式会社バンダイナムコゲームスに社名変更した後、2015年に株式会社バンダイナムコエンターテインメントに社名変更した。\\n\\n一方でアミューズメント部門を独立させた新法人「株式会社ナムコ」が2006年3月31日に設立され、同社は2018年にバンダイナムコエンターテインメントのアミューズメント機器部門を吸収して株式会社[[バンダイナムコアミューズメント]]に社名変更した。\\n\\n== 概要 ==\\n1955年6月1日、創業者[[中村雅哉]]が有限会社中村製作所を設立し、横浜のデパート屋上に2台の電動木馬を設置して事業をスタートさせた<ref name=\"BNE History\"/>。1959年に株式会社中村製作所へ改組して全国各地で遊戯施設の運営などを手掛け、1960年代中頃からはエレメカの開発製造を行うなど事業を拡大した。1974年、経営難に陥っていた米[[アタリ (企業)|アタリ]]の日本支社アタリジャパンを買収しビデオゲーム事業に参入した。1977年に社名をナムコに変更し、その1年後には初のオリジナルビデオゲーム『[[ジービー]]』を発売した。1979年に発売されたシューティングゲーム『[[ギャラクシアン]]』はナムコ最初の大ヒットゲームとなり、翌1980年には『[[パックマン]]』を発売し、日本のみならず北米でも大ヒットした。1980年代のナムコは『[[ニューラリーX]]』、『[[ギャラガ]]』、『[[ディグダグ]]』、『[[ポールポジション]]』、『[[ゼビウス]]』、『[[マッピー]]』『[[ドルアーガの塔]]』など人気作を次々リリースし、アーケード・ビデオゲームの黄金時代を築いた。\\n\\n1984年、ナムコはアーケードゲームソフトを任天堂[[ファミリーコンピュータ]]に移植し、家庭用ゲーム機市場に参入した。アーケードゲームの『パックマン』や『ゼビウス』などがゲームセンターと見劣りしない水準で家庭で遊べたことは当時のユーザーに衝撃を与えた。ナムコのアメリカ部門は1985年にアタリゲームズを買収したが、1987年には両社の意見の相違からアタリゲームズの一部を売却した。また任天堂とのライセンス契約をめぐる対立から、ナムコは[[PCエンジン]]や[[メガドライブ]]、そして[[PlayStation (ゲーム機)|プレイステーション]]といった競合プラットフォーム向けにゲームを制作するようになり、特にプレイステーション初期の成功に大きく貢献した。\\n\\n1990年代に入っても『[[リッジレーサー]]』や『[[鉄拳 (ゲーム)|鉄拳]]』シリーズ、2000年代初めには『[[太鼓の達人]]』などのヒットゲームを生み出し続けたが、1990年代後半から2000年代にかけて日本経済の低迷とアーケードゲーム市場の衰退により経営環境が厳しくなり、同業他社との業務提携や統合の検討といった動きが見られるようになった。2005年9月、ナムコはバンダイと経営統合し持株会社[[バンダイナムコホールディングス]]を設立、ナムコは同持株会社の子会社となった。\\n\\n2006年3月31日、組織再編によりバンダイのゲーム部門を統合して社名をバンダイナムコゲームスに変更した。また同日、旧ナムコのアミューズメント部門を独立させた別法人として株式会社ナムコが設立された。バンダイナムコゲームスは2015年に[[バンダイナムコエンターテインメント]]へ社名変更し、2代目ナムコは2018年に[[バンダイナムコアミューズメント]]へ社名変更した。\\n\\nナムコは『[[ファミスタシリーズ]]』『[[鉄拳シリーズ]]』『[[テイルズ オブ シリーズ]]』『[[リッジレーサーシリーズ]]』『[[エースコンバットシリーズ]]』などミリオンセラーを記録した数々の人気ゲームシリーズを生み出してきた。また、ゲームセンターやアミューズメント施設をグローバルに展開し、映画や玩具、業務用ゲーム機の制作、レストランチェーンの運営に加え『[[ワンダーエッグ]]』や『[[ナンジャタウン]]』といったテーマパークの運営なども行った。そのユニークな企業モデルや業界にとっての重要性、そして先進的な技術力で日本のゲーム産業史に足跡を残し、後継会社であるバンダイナムコゲームス（バンダイナムコエンターテインメント）とその子会社は、経営統合後もビデオゲームやその他のエンターテインメント製品に「ナムコ」ブランドを使用し続けた。\\n\\n==

NASA以前 ==\\n1930年に[[カリフォルニア州]]の[[サンフランシスコ]]で生まれ<ref name=\"navy-history-young\"/>、[[ジョージア工科大学]]を卒業<ref name=\"navy-history-young\"/>。大学では予備役士官課程を取得しており、1952年に士官として海軍へ入隊<ref name=\"navy-history-young\"/>、駆逐艦ローズ(USS Laws,DD-558)に配属され、[[朝鮮戦争]]中には周辺海域で任務に就いていた<ref name=\"navy-history-young\"/>。1953年より飛行訓練を受けている<ref name=\"navy-history-young\"/>。[[1959年]]に海軍[[テストパイロット]]となり、1962年2月21日には[[F-4 (戦闘機)|F4H]]で指定された高度までの到達時間を競う「ハイジャンプ計画」において顕著な成績を収めたことで有名となった。同年9月にNASAの第二期宇宙飛行士の選抜メンバーとして選出された。\\n\\n== NASA時代 ==\\n=== ジェミニ計画 ===\\n[[ジェミニ3号]]はジェミニ計画初の有人飛行であった。それ以前の[[マーキュリー計画]]の宇宙船は一人乗りだったため、[[ヴァージル・グリソム]]と共に初の二人での宇宙飛行となった。[[1965年]][[3月23日]]、ジェミニ3号は無事打ち上げられ、初の二人での宇宙飛行を成功させ、約5時間後地球に無事帰還した。なお、このときヤングは当時の味気ない[[宇宙食]]への不満から、内緒で船内に[[サンドイッチ]]を持ち込み、食した。この行為は安全面から批判されたが、同時に宇宙食の食味向上が行なわれるきっかけにもなった。\\n\\n二度目の飛行である[[ジェミニ10号]]では、初飛行である[[マイケル・コリンズ (宇宙飛行士)|マイケル・コリンズ]]と共に[[1966年]][[7月18日]]、打ち上げられ、ランデブーやドッキング、船外活動などが行われ、約3日後無事地球に帰還した。\\n\\n=== アポロ計画 ===\\n[[ファイル:Apollo 16 LM.jpg|thumb|right|250px|アポロ16号月着陸船]]\\nヤングはアポロ計画の最初の有人飛行である[[アポロ7号]]のバックアップの乗組員として割り当てられた。アポロ7号は[[ウォーリー・シラー]] 、[[ドン・アイズル]] 、[[ウォルター・カニンガム]]が搭乗し、[[1968年]][[10月11日]]、打ち上げられた。\\n\\nヤングは[[アポロ10号]]の司令船パイロットとして割り当てられた。アポロ10号での使命は二度目の月周回及び[[月]]軌道上での[[アポロ月着陸船|着陸船]]のテストであった。アポロ10号は[[1969年]][[5月18日]]に[[トーマス・スタッフォード]]（船長）、[[ユージン・サーナン]]（[[アポロ月着陸船|月着陸船]]パイロット）と共に[[サターンVロケット]]によって打ち上げられたものの、ヤングは司令船パイロットであったため、月着陸船のテスト飛行は行わず、1969年[[5月26日]]無事地球に帰還した。\\n\\nヤングはその後、[[アポロ16号]]の船長として割り当てられた。アポロ16号では、司令船パイロット[[ケン・マッティングリー]]、月着陸船パイロット[[チャールズ・デューク]]と共に[[1972年]][[4月16日]]、サターンVロケットによって打ち上げられた。打ち上げ後地球を3周した後、月へと向かい約3日で月へと到着した。一時司令船に異常が見られ月着陸が危ぶまれたが、この不調によるリスクは少ないと判断され、ヤングとデュークに着陸許可が下された。しかし、安全のためにミッションは、1日短縮された。ヤングとデュークが搭乗したアポロ16号月着陸船オライオンは[[4月21日]]、[[デカルト高地]]に着陸した。月面には約71時間滞在し3回の船外活動を行った。船外活動では1度目は7時間11分、2度目は7時間23分、3度目は5時間40分の計20時間14分に渡って行われた。また、アポロ16号は[[アポロ15号]]に続いて[[LRV

命名権獲得までの経緯 ===\\n[[理化学研究所]]のチームが、ロシアの[[ドゥブナ合同原子核研究所]]およびアメリカの[[ローレンス・リバモア国立研究所]]、[[オークリッジ国立研究所]]による合同研究チームと命名権を争うこととなり、その行方が注目されていた。\\n\\n理化学研究所のチームは2004年（平成16年）7月23日と2005年（平成17年）4月2日の2回の合成{{R|Morita2004|Morita2007}}をもって2006年（平成18年）と2007年（平成19年）に合同作業部会に申請したが{{R|rikennews|interview1|mynavi20120928|interview2}}、認定は見送られている{{R|rikennews|mynavi20120928|interview2}}。同チームはその後2008年（平成20年）から2009年（平成21年）にかけての実験で、[[放射性崩壊|崩壊]]過程で生じる[[ボーリウム|<sup>266</sup>Bh]]の存在をより確実にすることで証拠を補強した{{R|rikennews|mynavi20120928|interview2|Morita2009}}。しかし[[2011年]]（平成23年）1月に発表された、[[国際純正・応用化学連合]] (IUPAC) と[[国際純粋・応用物理学連合]] (IUPAP) の113から116および118番元素についての合同作業部会の報告書{{R|IUPAC2011}}でも、113番元素の認定は見送られている。その一方で米露のグループは114番元素と116番元素の発見を認定されている。これは理化学研究所のような確実な証拠が無くとも充分な状況証拠があれば命名権が得られる前例となり、理化学研究所にとっては逆風となった{{R|sankei20160121}}。\\n\\n理化学研究所のチームは2012年（平成24年）の合同作業部会にも申請しており、その審議中の8月12日に3個目の生成に成功している{{refnest|group=\"注\"|ただし、生成の成功が明らかとなったのは同年[[8月18日]]の事である{{R|rikennews|interview2}}。}}{{R|rikennews|mynavi20120928|Morita2012|interview2}}。[[レントゲニウム]]は[[重イオン研究所]]が3個目の生成後に命名権を得ているため、命名権を獲得できる可能性が高まった。この年の申請は5月に締め切られており、追加の証拠という形で受理はされたものの、直ちに認定とはならなかった{{R|sankei20160121}}。さらに何回か生成と崩壊系列を確認すれば命名権がより確実になるものの、必要な設備<ref group=\"注\">線形加速器だけでなく、粒子を捕捉して崩壊を観測する装置などが必要。</ref>は動かすのに数百万[[円 (通貨)|円]]から数十億円かかり、容易ではなかった。一方で翌年の[[2013年]]（平成25年）には米露のグループも状況証拠のみで命名権を満たす程度の充分なデータを揃えており、もし前年に理化学研究所が3例目の証拠を提出していなければこの時点で米露のグループが命名権を得ていた可能性が高かったと関係者は見ている{{R|sankei20160121}}。\\n\\n2015年（平成27年）8月のIUPAC評議会{{R|IUPAC20150812}}では認定および命名権の付与が検討されたものの決定が延期となっており、同年12月30日（日本時間31日早朝）にようやく認定に至った。\\n\\n=== 承認の背景 ===\\n114から118番元素まではいずれも[[アクチノイド]]をターゲットにした励起エネルギーの高い「熱い[[核融合反応|核融合]]」により、合成に成功したグループに命名権が与えられている。この手法は、重い原子核を材料とするため成功率は高いが、必然的に中性子を多く含むため[[自発核分裂]]を生じやすく、『崩壊系列が、既知の核種に到達すること』という発見の大原則を達成できず、状況証拠どまりとなりがちだった。\\n\\n一方、113番元素において理化学研究所は、中程度の重さの原子核同士を材料とする「[[超アクチノイド元素#超重元素の合成法と特徴|冷たい核融合（コールドフュージョン）]]」により、自発核分裂を起こさず既知の核種に崩壊系列が繋がる、確実な証拠を得ることに成功した{{refnest|group=\"注\"|しかし中性子の少ない未発見元素の合成はほぼ限界に達しており、そのような確実な証拠をもって命名権が与えられた元素は、この時点でニホニウムが最後となっている。将来的にも、119番以降の元素のコールドフュージョンは期待されていない{{R|mynavi20120928|riken20170301}}。}}。\\n\\n=== 元素名の候補 ===\\n理化学研究所の新元素合成実験は[[1990年代]]後半に「'''ジャポニウム計画'''」<ref group=\"注\">日本を表す[[ラテン語]]の「{{読み仮名|japonia|ジャポニア}}」にちなむ。</ref>と名付けられ、以来実施されてきた経緯があり{{R|rikennews200411|sankei20160123}}、113番元素の名称についても「ジャポニウム」（元素記号：Jp、Jn）<ref group=\"注\">これにより、周期表に初めて「J」の文字が出現する可能性があった。</ref>もしくは「ジャパニウム」という名称が最有力とみられていたが、結果的に除外された{{R|mainichi160608|sankei160608-2}}。2016年（平成28年）6月8日には前述のとおり同研究所のチームがIUPACに提出した名称案は「ニホニウム」（元素記号：Nh）であることが公表された{{R|iupac20160608|IUPAC20160608|riken20160608|sankei160608}}。\\n\\nなお、この他には同研究所所在地の[[和光市]]から「ワコニウム」、和光市の旧地名でもある[[大和町 (曖昧さ回避)|大和町]]から「ヤマトニウム」、物理学者の[[仁科芳雄]]にちなむ「ニシナニウム」などの候補も挙がっていた{{R|nikkei20120927}}。また「ニッポニウム」（元素記号：Np）は、[[テクネチウム|43番元素]]として一度命名されたものの取り消された、[[レニウム]]を巡る過去の経緯から混乱を避けるため採用できないルールとなっており、除外されていた{{R|IUPAC2002|riken_history}}。\\n\\n==== ネイチャー誌上での予想 ====\\n[[イギリス]]の科学雑誌『[[ネイチャー]]』はブログ版「{{lang|en|The Sceptical Chymist}}」で専門家による元素名の予想をオッズ付きで行なっており、このページでは上記の候補の他に、[[天照大神]]にちなんだ「{{読み仮名|Amaterasium|アマテラシウム}}」や、[[煙々羅]]にちなんだ「{{読み仮名|Enenraium|エネンライウム}}」、[[ゴジラ (架空の怪獣)|ゴジラ]]にちなんだ「{{読み仮名|Godzillium|ゴジリウム}}」なども候補に挙がっていた{{R|Satou20160212|nature20160126}}。\\n\\n==== 理化学研究所の発表 ====\\n2016年（平成28年）6月8日、[[理化学研究所]]は113番元素の新名称として「{{読み仮名|nihonium|ニホニウム}}」（元素記号：Nh）と命名する案を発表した{{R|NHK160608|riken20160608|sankei160608}}。\\n\\n=== 正式決定 ===\\n国際純正・応用化学連合 (IUPAC)

Discovered by RIKEN's Morita team in Japan, it was officially recognized as Asia's first new element name. As a transuranic element, its most stable isotope, <sup>286</sup>Nh, has a half-life of about 19.6 seconds, while other isotopes are extremely short-lived and decay via alpha decay into Rg. Initially reported in 2004, the third synthesis was confirmed in 2012. Before its official naming, it was temporarily called ununtrium (Uut). It is one of the newest elements added to the periodic table and the first element named in Asia.) \\n\\n(Note: The translation is provided for clarity and understanding but is not part of the requested summary in Japanese.)\n",

Khafji}}）とは、[[湾岸戦争]]中の[[1991年]][[1月29日]]から[[2月1日]]にかけて、[[クウェート＝サウジアラビア国境]]地帯の[[カフジ]]周辺で、[[アメリカ軍]]・[[サウジアラビア軍]]を中心とする[[多国籍軍]]と[[バアス党政権 (イラク)|イラク]]軍の間で戦われた[[戦闘]]である。\\n\\n== 戦闘に至る経緯 ==\\n=== カフジ攻撃の決定 ===\\n[[1990年]]8月2日の[[クウェート侵攻]]を受け、国際社会は[[イラク]]に撤退を要求して[[経済制裁]]を課し、その実効性を確保するとともにサウジアラビアを防衛するため、[[西側諸国]]や[[アラブ世界|アラブ諸国]]は[[軍隊]]を派遣した{{Sfn|外務省|1991}}。しかし国際的な圧力にもかかわらずイラクの姿勢は軟化せず、[[アメリカ軍]]を中心とする[[多国籍軍]]は、1991年1月17日未明より[[砂漠の嵐作戦]]を発動し、イラクに対する武力行使を開始した{{Sfn|外務省|1991}}{{Sfn|山崎|2010|pp=64-69}}。\\n\\n砂漠の嵐作戦の第一段階は、圧倒的に優勢な航空兵力によってイラク指導者層の指揮機能を奪うとともに中心となる軍事力を破壊することに重点を置いた戦略的航空作戦とされた{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=374-381}}。イラクの[[サッダーム・フセイン|フセイン大統領]]は、多国籍軍の航空攻撃は1週間程度であろうと予想していたが{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}、作戦第2週（1月24－30日）に入ると、第1週において航空作戦を中断させた悪天候も晴れ上がったことで、多国籍軍の航空攻撃はむしろ強化された{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=410-412}}。\\n\\nまた外交交渉も行き詰まっており、この難局を打開するため、1月下旬、フセイン大統領は[[カフジ]]に対する攻撃を命じた{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。これは、多国籍軍に地上戦を挑むことで反撃を誘発し、消耗戦に引き込むことでアメリカ国民の戦意を動揺させ{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}、また対外的に宣伝しうる戦果を得るためであった{{Sfn|山崎|2010|pp=64-69}}。\\n\\n=== 攻撃前のカフジの状況 ===\\n[[砂漠の盾作戦]]においてカフジの周辺に配置されていた部隊は、[[アメリカ海兵隊]]の中央軍海兵隊（MARCENT）と、[[サウジアラビア軍]]を主体とする東部合同軍（{{Lang|en|Joint Force Command-East}}: JFC-E）だった{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。\\n\\nカフジはイラク軍砲兵部隊の射程圏内に入っていたことから市民は既に避難しており、MARCENTの上級部隊指揮官にあたる[[アメリカ中央軍]]司令官[[ノーマン・シュワルツコフ|シュワルツコフ大将]]も、またJFC-Eの上級部隊指揮官にあたるアラブ合同軍司令官[[:en:Khalid bin Sultan Al Saud|ハリド中将]]も、同地の保持は困難と判断したことから、直接防衛する部隊は配置されなかった{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。一方、イラク軍によるサウジアラビア侵攻を警戒するため、[[クウェート＝サウジアラビア国境]]沿い7か所に監視所を設置するとともに、アメリカ海兵隊と[[サウジアラビア陸軍]]・[[サウジアラビア国家警備隊|国家警備隊]]および[[クウェート軍|クウェート陸軍]]の計5個大隊が警戒部隊となって展開していた{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。\\n\\n一方のイラク陸軍では、[[:en:3rd Corps (Iraq)|第3軍団]]隷下の[[:en:3rd Division (Iraq)|第3機甲師団]]・[[:en:5th Division (Iraq)|第5機械化師団]]、第4軍団隷下の[[:en:1st Division (Iraq)|第1機械化師団]]をカフジ攻撃に割り当てて、第3軍団長[[:en:Salah Aboud Mahmoud|マフムード少将]]が指揮官に任命された{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。マフムード少将は、[[イラン・イラク戦争]]時にアメリカから衛星情報の提供を受けた経験があったことから、[[偵察衛星]]にも注意しつつ、夜間を活用して慎重に部隊を攻撃開始位置に配置した{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。3個師団の攻撃準備を完全に秘匿することは困難で、移動中の部隊の一部は多国籍軍の航空攻撃を受けたほか、アメリカ海兵隊の情報部隊は無線傍受によってイラク軍[[工兵]]部隊が戦車用の機動路を整備していることを察知、また1月25日には、[[中央情報局]]（CIA）もイラク軍が国境線の監視所を襲撃する可能性があると警告した{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。しかし中央軍司令部では、もしイラク軍が攻勢に出る場合は、[[キング・ハリド軍事都市]]に向けて攻撃するか、あるいは{{仮リンク|アル＝バティン・ワジ|en|Wadi Al-Batin}}沿いに攻撃するだろうと予想していたため、カフジ攻撃を準備していることを見抜くことができず、奇襲を受ける結果となった{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。\\n\\n== 戦闘の経過 ==\\n=== イラク軍の攻撃 ===\\n1月29日夜、イラク軍はカフジに対する攻撃を開始した{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。西側から順番に第1機械化師団、第3機甲師団、第5機械化師団が並列しており、東部合同軍（JFC-E）地区において海岸沿いを攻撃する第5機械化師団が主攻撃と位置付けられ、第3機甲師団はその西側側面を掩護した{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。一方、アメリカ海兵隊の防御地区を攻撃する第1機械化師団は助攻撃と位置付けられたほか{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}、これらとは別に、多国籍軍の航空攻撃を引き付けるため1個機甲師団が国境近傍のアル・ルキに対する攻撃を行うこととされた{{Sfn|阿部|2021}}。\\n\\n第1機械化師団による攻撃は、散発的な航空攻撃と軽微な抵抗を受けただけで、大きな損害を受けることもなく、30日の夜明け前には計画通り[[クウェート]]地区内に帰還した{{Sfn|阿部|2021}}。一方、第3機甲師団については、マフムード少将は同師団の第6旅団をサウジアラビア領内奥深くに突進させることを企図したが、同旅団は航空機の協力を受けたアメリカ海兵隊の抵抗に遭遇し、戦車・装甲車あわせて22両を喪失{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}、日が変わる前に後退した{{Sfn|阿部|2021}}。旅団は精神的にも崩壊し、指揮官は更迭され、「残っていたのは名前だけであった」とイラク側は記録している{{Sfn|阿部|2021}}。\\n\\nただし、基本的には監視所および警戒部隊は頑強に抵抗するというよりは後退を選び、1月30日午前2時、イラク陸軍第5機械化師団隷下の第15機械化旅団がカフジを占領した{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。なおこの際、アメリカ海兵隊は[[同士討ち|友軍相撃]]によって[[装輪装甲車]]2両を失っており、以後、再発防止策が徹底されることになった{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。\\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"150px\">\\nFile:RemnantsofLAV25.jpg|友軍の対戦車ミサイルにより破壊されたアメリカ海兵隊のLAV-AT装甲車\\nFile:KnockedoutIraqiT62khafji.jpg|多国籍軍により破壊されたイラク軍のT-62戦車\\n</gallery>\\n\\n=== 多国籍軍の反撃 ===\\n[[File:Battle of Khafji 1991.svg|thumb|250px|JFC-Eによる反撃の概要]]\\nアメリカ軍にとって、カフジの失陥は想定外ではあったが、絶対的航空優勢下ではこれを奪還することは困難ではないと判断し、楽観視していた{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。しかし[[二聖モスクの守護者]]の称号を受けていたサウジアラビアの[[ファハド・ビン＝アブドゥルアズィーズ|ファハド国王]]にとって、寸土とはいえフセイン大統領の占領を許すことは看過し難く、ハリド中将に対して、速やかにこれを奪回することを繰り返し要求した{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。ハリド中将は、アメリカ軍の手で同地を奪回されることを恥辱と考えて、サウジアラビア軍の手でカフジを奪回することを決意していた{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。\\n\\n30日、東部合同軍（JFC-E）司令官[[:ar:سلطان بن عادي المطيري|スルタン]]少将は、[[サウジアラビア国家警備隊]]第2自動車化歩兵旅団長アルファミィ大佐にカフジの奪回を命じた{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。アルファミィ大佐は、同旅団の第7機械化大隊及びカタール軍の2個戦車中隊によって奪回作戦を行うことを企図していたが、両国軍は湾岸危機の以前には共同訓練を行った経験がなく、またこの時点でも、同地一帯の地図、両部隊間の連絡を確保するための通信手段及び火力運用に関する計画はなかった{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。アメリカ海兵隊から派遣された連絡将校は、作戦開始前に火力調整を実施するよう助言したが、ファハド国王から速やかなカフジ奪回を命じられていた大隊長は作戦を強行した{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。\\n\\nこのような事情からJFC-Eの攻撃は統制を欠いており、2度にわたり失敗した{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。しかしイラク側も多国籍軍の激しい航空攻撃に苦しんでおり、マフムード少将は後退の許可を繰り返し求めたが、これは許可されなかった{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。そしてJFC-Eの3度目の攻撃は成功し、アメリカ海兵隊の砲兵射撃や攻撃機・攻撃ヘリコプターの援護下に、第7機械化大隊はカフジ市内に突入した{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。2月1日朝にはカフジ全域が確保され、後退するイラク軍に対して執拗な対地攻撃が継続された{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。\\n\\n== 事後の評価 ==\\nカフジ攻撃において主攻撃を担任していたイラク陸軍第3軍団第5機械化師団のうち、無事にクウェートに帰還した部隊は全体の2割程度であった{{Sfn|防衛研究所戦史研究センター|2021|pp=94-109}}。また撃退に成功したアラブ合同軍が自信を持つことにもつながったことから、西側諸国においては、この戦闘は多国籍軍の勝利とみなされている{{Sfn|阿部|2021}}。\\n\\n一方、フセイン大統領は、イラク軍の人的損害がアメリカ軍の損害の4倍を超えなければ大勝利であるとみなしていたことから、第5機械化師団についてそれほど大きな損害を受けていないとし、逆に「…31日に第5機械化師団は空襲を360回受けた。一方[[エジプト]]は1967年に、[[イスラエル空軍]]の150機の飛行機に敗れている。つまり、150機の攻撃で国が敗北する場合があるのに対して、イラク軍では、1個師団が360回もの空襲に耐えたのである。」と、多国籍軍による圧倒的な航空攻撃に耐え抜いたことを誇った{{Sfn|阿部|2021}}。[[共和国防衛隊]]では第5機械化師団の成果を羨望し、同様の任務を自分たちが行うことを切望した{{Sfn|阿部|2021}}。当時の[[バアス党政権 (イラク)|イラク政権]]の公刊史においては、この戦闘はサダム・フセインが「現代の偉大な軍事戦略家」であることを証明した戦いであったとし、1991年以降、イラク陸軍大学における重要な教育課目とされた{{Sfn|阿部|2021}}。\\n\\n== 脚注 ==\\n{{脚注ヘルプ}}\\n<!-- === 注釈 ===\\n{{Notelist2}} -->\\n=== 出典

カフジの戦闘は、1991年1月29日から2月1日にかけて、湾岸戦争中にクウェート＝サウジアラビア国境近くのカフジで、多国籍軍（米国とサウジアラビア）とイラク軍との間に起こった戦闘である。イラク軍は、多国籍軍の地上戦への引き込みや、アメリカ国民の戦意低下、そして対外的な宣伝のためにカフジへの攻撃を企画した。カフジには直接防衛部隊は配置されていなかったが、多国籍軍は警戒部隊として5個大隊を展開していた。戦闘では、イラク軍がカフジを占領したものの、多国籍軍の空爆により大きな被害を受け、最終的には多国籍軍が勝利した。両軍の戦死者数は、多国籍軍が43人、イラク軍が60-300人だった。この戦闘は、イラク軍の戦略的失敗を示すものとなった。\n",
