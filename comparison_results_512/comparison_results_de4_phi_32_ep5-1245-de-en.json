The size of the top and bottom can vary, from bikinis that offer full coverage of the breasts, pelvis, and buttocks, to more revealing designs with a [[thong]] or [[G-string]] bottom that covers only the [[mons pubis]], but exposes the buttocks, and a top that covers only the [[areola]]e. Bikini bottoms covering about half the buttocks may be described as \"Brazilian-cut\".\n\nThe modern bikini swimsuit was introduced by French clothing designer [[Louis Réard]] in July 1946, and was named after the [[Bikini Atoll]], where the first public test of a [[nuclear bomb]] had taken place four days before.<ref name=\"weisgall\">{{cite book|last=Weisgall|first=Jonathan M.|title=Operation Crossroads: The atomic tests at Bikini Atoll|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=1994|pages=263–264}}</ref>\n\nDue to its revealing design, the bikini was once considered controversial, facing opposition from a number of groups and being accepted only very slowly by the general public. In many countries, the design was banned from beaches and other public places: in 1949, France banned the bikini from being worn on its coastlines; Germany banned the bikini from public swimming pools until the 1970s, and some communist groups condemned the bikini as a \"capitalist decadence\".<ref name=Alac/> The bikini also faced criticism from some feminists, who reviled it as a garment designed to suit men's tastes, and not those of women. Despite this backlash, however, the bikini still sold well throughout the mid to late 20th century.\n\nThe bikini gained increased exposure and acceptance as [[film star]]s like [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Raquel Welch]], and [[Ursula Andress]] wore it and were photographed on public beaches and seen in film.<ref name=Alac>{{cite book |last=Alac |first=Patrik |title=Bikini Story |year=2012|publisher=Parkstone International |isbn=978-1-78042-951-9|edition=first |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIj_GBl5sAoC}}</ref> The minimalist bikini design became common in most Western countries by the mid-1960s as both [[swimwear]] and [[underwear]].

There are a number of modern [[Bikini variant|stylistic variations]] of the design used for marketing purposes and as industry classifications, including [[monokini]], [[microkini]], [[tankini]], [[trikini]], [[pubikini]], [[skirtini]], [[thong]], and [[g-string]].

Aside from the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]], it is found in [[tropical]] and [[temperate]] waters worldwide. This rarely encountered shark swims close to the bottom of the seafloor, typically at depths of {{convert|400|-|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}, though it may enter much shallower water. The bramble shark has a stout body with two small [[dorsal fin]]s positioned far back and no [[anal fin]]. It can be readily identified by the large, thornlike [[dermal denticle]]s scattered over its body, some of which may be fused together. It is purplish brown or black in color and grows up to {{convert|3.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.\n\nThe diet of the bramble shark includes smaller sharks, [[bony fish]]es, and [[crab]]s, which this slow-moving species may capture via suction. It is [[aplacental viviparous]], with females producing litters of 15–52 pups. Harmless to humans, it is an occasional [[bycatch]] of [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing|recreational fishers]], and may be used for [[fishmeal]] and [[shark liver oil|liver oil]]. Its population has declined substantially in the northeastern Atlantic since the 18th and 19th centuries, likely because of [[overfishing]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe original description of the bramble shark was authored by French [[naturalist]] [[Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre]] in the 1788 ''[[Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique|Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois regnes de la nature]]''. He named it ''Squalus brucus'', from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''brux'' or ''bruchios'' meaning \"from the depths of the sea\".<ref name=\"bonnaterre\"/><ref name=\"castro\"/> The [[type specimen]] has since been lost.<ref name=\"compagno\"/> In 1816, [[Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville|Henri de Blainville]] created the genus ''Echinorhinus'' for this species.<ref name=\"blainville\"/> Until the 1960s, specimens of the [[prickly shark]] (''E. cookei'') caught in the Pacific Ocean were misidentified as bramble sharks.<ref name=\"castro\"/> Other common names for this species are spinous shark and spiny shark.<ref name=\"fishbase\"/>\n\n==Description==\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Echinorhinus brucus Mc Coy.jpg|image2=Echinorhinus brucus denticle.jpg|caption2=Distinctive traits of the bramble shark include its posteriorly placed dorsal fins, lack of an anal fin, and large thornlike dermal denticles (detail below).}}\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Echinorhinus brucus jaws.jpg|image2=Echinorhinus brucus teeth2.jpg|image3=Echinorhinus brucus teeth.jpg|caption3=Jaws, lower and upper teeth}}\n\nThe bramble shark has a thick, cylindrical body and a somewhat flattened head. The snout is blunt and shorter than the width of the mouth, with widely spaced nostrils that are preceded by small flaps of skin. The eyes lack [[nictitating membrane]]s; the tiny [[Spiracle (vertebrates)|spiracle]]s are located well behind them. The wide, curved mouth bears very short furrows at the corners. There are 20–26 upper and 22–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is knife-like, with a single main cusp and up to three cusplets on either side. There are five pairs of [[gill slit]]s, with the fifth pair the longest.<ref name=\"compagno\"/><ref name=\"mceachran and fechhelm\"/>\n\nThe [[pectoral fin]]s are short and angular, while the [[pelvic fin]]s are long and relatively large. The [[dorsal fin]]s are small, with the first dorsal fin origin lying behind the pelvic fin origins. There is no [[anal fin]]. The [[caudal peduncle]] is robust and lacks notches at the [[caudal fin]] origins. The asymmetrical caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and an upper lobe without a notch in the trailing margin.<ref name=\"kabasakal et al\"/>\n\nThe skin is covered by a layer of foul-smelling [[mucus]] several millimeters thick.<ref name=\"martin\"/><ref name=\"kemp\"/> The [[dermal denticle]]s are scattered irregularly over the body and vary greatly in size, measuring up to {{convert|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} across. Each denticle is thornlike in shape, with ridges radiating out from the central point over the base. As many as ten denticles may be fused together to form multi-pointed plates. The underside of the snout and the area around the mouth is densely covered by small denticles in sharks under {{convert|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; these denticles become larger and sparser in larger sharks. This species is brown to black above, with a metallic purplish hue, and paler below; some individuals have red or black blotches. There is a report of one specimen that had a greenish glow when freshly caught. The bramble shark may reach {{convert|3.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length. The maximum weight on record is {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for a {{convert|2.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} long female.<ref name=\"compagno et al\"/><ref name=\"castro\"/><ref name=\"compagno\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nRecords of the bramble shark are fairly rare and originate from widely scattered locations in [[tropical]] and [[temperate]] waters worldwide, save for the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]. Most have come from the eastern [[Atlantic]] and western [[Indian Ocean]]s, where its range extends from the [[North Sea]] and the [[British Isles]] to southern [[Mozambique]], including the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

It was recorded at Century Sound Studios in New York during September and October 1968, and released in November of the same year by [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\nThe album's music blends [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[classical music|classical]] styles, signalling a radical departure from the sound of Morrison's previous [[pop music|pop]] hits, such as \"[[Brown Eyed Girl]]\" (1967). The lyrics and [[cover art]] portray the symbolism equating earthly love and heaven that would often feature in the singer's subsequent records. His lyrics have been described as [[impressionism|impressionistic]], [[hypnosis|hypnotic]], and [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|modernist]], while the record has been categorized as a [[song cycle]] or [[concept album]].\n\n''Astral Weeks'' did not originally receive promotion from Morrison's record label and was not an immediate success with consumers or critics. Its standing eventually improved greatly, with praise given to Morrison's singing, arrangements and songwriting, and the album has been viewed as one of [[rock music]]'s greatest and most important records (a reputation the singer himself has dismissed). It was placed on numerous widely circulated lists of the best albums of all time and has had an enduring effect on both listeners and musicians.\n\nForty years after the album's release, Morrison performed all eight of its songs live for the first time at two [[Hollywood Bowl]] concerts in November 2008; this performance was later released as ''[[Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl]]''.\n\n==Background==\nAt the beginning of 1968, Van Morrison became involved in a contract dispute with [[Bang Records]] that kept him away from any recording activity. This occurred after the sudden death of the label's founder [[Bert Berns]]. Born with a congenital heart defect, Berns had a fatal heart attack, and was discovered dead in a New York hotel room on 30 December 1967.<ref name=\"HeylinPage164\">Heylin (2003), p. 164.</ref> Prior to Berns's death, he and Morrison had experienced some creative difficulties; Berns had been pushing Morrison in a more pop-oriented direction, while Morrison wanted to explore newer musical terrain.<ref name=\"HeylinPage158-164\">Heylin (2003), pp. 158–164.</ref> Berns's widow, [[Ilene Berns]], held Morrison and this conflict responsible for her husband's death. Years later she would downplay this scenario, but Morrison's then girlfriend Janet (Planet) Rigsbee has since gone on record describing Ilene Berns's subsequent vindictiveness towards Morrison.<ref name=\"HeylinPage167\">Heylin (2003), p. 167.</ref>\n\nFollowing Bert Berns's death, Ilene Berns inherited the contracts of Bang Records.<ref name=\"HeylinPage165\">Heylin (2003), p. 165.</ref> Morrison's annual option on his recording contract was also due less than a week after Berns's funeral.<ref name=\"HeylinPage166\">Heylin (2003), p. 166.</ref> Legally bound to Bang Records, Morrison was not only kept out of the studio, but also found himself unable to find performing work in New York as most clubs refrained from booking him, fearing reprisals. (Bert Berns was notorious for his connections to organized crime, and those connections still affected artists like Morrison and [[Neil Diamond]] trying to leave Bang Records, even after Berns's death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/04/27/525055587/bang-the-bert-berns-story-the-complicated-man-behind-twist-and-shout|title='BANG! The Bert Berns Story': The Complicated Man Behind 'Twist And Shout'|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=27 April 2017|access-date=31 August 2020}}</ref>) Ilene Berns then discovered that her late husband had previously been remiss in filing the appropriate paperwork to keep Morrison (still a British citizen) in New York, and contacted [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] in an attempt to have Morrison deported. However, Morrison managed to stay in the U.S. when Janet Rigsbee agreed to marry him.<ref name=\"HeylinPage166-168\">Heylin (2003), pp. 166–168.</ref> Once married, Morrison and Rigsbee moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where he found work performing in local clubs. Morrison began performing with a small electric combo doing [[blues]] numbers, and songs from ''[[Blowin' Your Mind!]]'' and from Morrison's [[Them (band)|Them]] band days. Two of the musicians soon left but Morrison retained the bassist, Tom Kielbania, a student at the [[Berklee School of Music]].<ref name= \"HeylinPage169-172\">Heylin (2003), pp. 169–172.</ref> Morrison decided to try an acoustic sound, and he and Kielbania began performing shows in coffee houses in the [[Boston]] area as an acoustic duo with Morrison playing guitar and Kielbania on [[double bass|upright bass]]. Before this, Morrison had primarily recorded and performed with electric musicians. The acoustic medium would provide him \"greater vocal improvisation and a freer, folkier feel\".<ref name=\"HagePage40\">Hage (2009), p. 40.</ref>\n\nLater, Kielbania heard [[jazz]]-trained flautist John Payne for the first time while sitting in on a jam session. He invited Payne to the club where he played with Morrison, hoping Morrison would invite him to join them. After allowing Payne to sit in on one performance, Morrison extended an invitation, which Payne accepted.<ref name= \"HeylinPage172-173\">Heylin (2003), pp. 172–173.</ref> The trio of Payne, Kielbania, and Morrison continued performing for four months. In the weeks they played at the Catacombs, they began to develop the template for ''Astral Weeks''.<ref name=\"HeylinPage173\">Heylin (2003), p. 173.</ref> It was around this time that [[Warner Bros. Records]] approached Morrison, hoping to sign him.<ref name= \"HeylinPage176\">Heylin (2003), p. 176.</ref> Presumably, their interest focused on his prior success with \"[[Brown-Eyed Girl]]\", not on Morrison's current acoustic work. Regardless, their interest allowed Morrison to return to the recording studio.<ref name= \"HeylinPage177\">Heylin (2003), p. 177.</ref>\n\nAt the time, Warner Bros. had a deal with Inherit Productions, the production arm of Schwaid-Merenstein, which was founded by manager Bob Schwaid (who worked for Warners Publishing) and producer [[Lewis Merenstein]]. Merenstein received a call from Warner Bros. to see Morrison in Boston, and related how eight or nine producers had gone to hear Morrison, thinking they were going to hear \"Brown Eyed Girl\" only to find that \"it was another person with the same voice\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drb.ie/essays/van-the-youth|title=Essay Book Reviews - Irish Book Reviews - Dublin Review of Books|website=www.drb.ie}}</ref> Merenstein first heard Morrison play at Ace Recording studio and recalled that when Morrison played the song \"[[Astral Weeks (song)|Astral Weeks]]\" for him, \"I started crying. It just vibrated in my soul, and I knew that I wanted to work with that sound.\"<ref name=\"HeylinPage177\"/> While Merenstein was visiting Morrison, Schwaid set to work on resolving Morrison's contractual troubles<ref name=\"HeylinPage177-181\">Heylin (2003), pp. 177–181.</ref> with the help of legendary Warner Bros. executive [[Joe Smith (music industry executive)|Joe Smith]], who would ultimately sign Morrison to Warner Bros.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2015/03/24/van-morrison-astral-weeks/2/|title=Astral Sojourn: The untold story of how Van Morrison fled record-industry thugs, hid out in Boston, and wrote one of rock's greatest albums.|magazine=[[Boston (magazine)|Boston]]|date=24 March 2015|access-date=31 August 2020}}</ref>\n\nStill legally bound to Bang Records, Morrison would yet have more issues with them in the future. For the time being, Schwaid managed to free him from those obligations, under several conditions. First, Morrison had to write and submit to Web IV Music (Bert Berns's publishing company) three original compositions per month over the course of one year. Morrison fulfilled that obligation by [[New York Sessions '67|recording thirty-six nonsense songs in a single session]]. Such action risked legal reprisals, but ultimately none transpired. Morrison then had to assign Web IV half of the copyright to any musical composition written and recorded by Morrison ''and'' released as a single within one year from 12 September 1968. That demand became a moot point when Warner Bros. refrained from releasing any singles during that time, as no single was released from ''Astral Weeks''. Finally, Morrison had to include two original compositions controlled by Web IV on his next album. Morrison fulfilled that demand with two of his own compositions, \"[[Madame George]]\" and \"[[Beside You (Van Morrison song)|Beside You]]\", although the versions subsequently released were vastly different musically from the original versions recorded with Bang.<ref name=\"HeylinPage178-181\">Heylin (2003), pp. 178–181.</ref>\n\nThere were still demands that weren't given on paper, which Smith tried to deal with through [[Don Rickles]]'s manager, Joe Scandore. Scandore, whom Smith described as \"connected\", set up an unusual arrangement where Smith had to arrive one evening at an abandoned warehouse on 9th Avenue in [[Manhattan]] at 6&nbsp;p.m. with a bag containing $20,000 USD in cash. According to Smith, \"I had to walk up three flights of stairs, and they were four guys. Two tall and thin, and two built like buildings. There was no small talk.

The live tracks for the sessions were performed by Morrison on vocals and acoustic guitar in a separate vocal booth<ref name= \"HeylinPage191\">Heylin (2003), p. 191.</ref> with the other musicians playing together on upright bass, lead acoustic guitar, vibes, flute, and drums. The strings and horns constituted the only instruments added subsequently to the initial recording sessions.<ref name= \"RoganPage227\">Rogan (2006), p. 227.</ref> Morrison said later \"They ruined it.

R&B and soul, yes; but jazz, no.\"<ref name= \"HeylinPage189\">Heylin (2003), p. 189.</ref> For the ''Astral Weeks'' recording sessions, Merenstein first contacted veteran bassist [[Richard Davis (double bassist)|Richard Davis]]. Perhaps best known for his work with [[Eric Dolphy]], Davis essentially served as the session leader, and it was through Davis that Merenstein recruited guitarist [[Jay Berliner]], percussionist [[Warren Smith (jazz musician)|Warren Smith Jr.]], and drummer [[Connie Kay]]. All of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz; Berliner had worked closely with [[Charles Mingus]] and Kay was part of the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]].<ref name= \"HeylinPage190\">Heylin (2003), p. 190.</ref> Morrison was still working with Kielbania and Payne but, for these sessions, they were essentially replaced. According to Kielbania, \"I got to show all the bass lines to Richard Davis. He embellished a lot of them, but I gave him the feeling.\"<ref name= \"HeylinPage190\" />\n\nDavis proved, perhaps, to be the most pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. \"If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and everybody followed Richard and Van's voice\", says Merenstein. \"I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van.\"<ref name= \"HeylinPage190\" /> Davis was not impressed by Morrison, not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. \"No prep, no meeting\", recalls Davis. \"He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth&nbsp;... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him&nbsp;... And he seemed very shy\".<ref name= \"HeylinPage191\"/> Drummer Connie Kay later told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that he approached Morrison and asked \"what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed.\"<ref name= \"HeylinPage192\">Heylin (2003), p. 192.</ref> Morrison's impression of the sessions was \"The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [But] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are.\"<ref name=\"HeylinPage192\"/> He told [[Ritchie Yorke]] that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. \"One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album.\"<ref>Yorke, (1975) p. 52.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n | quote  =You have to understand something,&nbsp;...

Only three had initially been intended for inclusion: \"[[Cyprus Avenue]]\", \"[[Madame George]]\", and \"[[Beside You (Van Morrison song)|Beside You]]\".<ref name=\"TurnerPages 86-89\">Turner (1993), pp. 86–89.</ref> Although not scheduled to play, Payne still attended the first session and listened as another flautist played his parts. To this day, nobody recalls the name of this flautist, nor has he been identified on any of the surviving documentation; he does play flute on the released takes of \"Beside You\" and \"Cyprus Avenue\" but is not included in the album credits. When Morrison tried to squeeze in one last tune during the end of that first session, Payne spoke up and pleaded to Merenstein to permit him to participate. Payne was then allowed to play on what became the title track of the album – \"[[Astral Weeks (song)|Astral Weeks]]\" – the fourth song produced from this initial session.  For the remainder of the sessions, John Payne played on every song.<ref name= \"HeylinPage194\"/>\n\nThe next session, according to John Payne, occurred early in the morning, but it did not work and nothing from this session worked for the final album. \"It just didn't happen\" says Payne. \"It was the wrong time of day for jazz musicians to create.

That was the whole album.\"<ref name=\"YorkePage51\">Yorke (1975), p. 51.</ref> In his biography, Clinton Heylin gives the date for the second session as 1 October and states that \"Only 'As Young Lovers Do' from this session would make the album\" contending that this is the reason for the different \"lounge-jazz sound\" on this track.<ref name=\"HeylinPage195\">Heylin, (2003), p. 195.</ref> Other biographers have primarily noted that the early morning first of October session was abandoned without producing any of the songs on the album.<ref name=TurnerPage90/><ref name=\"HintonPage89\">Hinton (1997), p. 89.</ref><ref name=\"Collis, 1996 p. 31\">Collis, (1996) p. 31.</ref>\n\nThe third and final session, in the evening on 15 October, produced four more recordings that completed the album&nbsp;— \"[[The Way Young Lovers Do]]\" \"[[Sweet Thing (Van Morrison song)|Sweet Thing]]\", \"[[Ballerina (Van Morrison song)|Ballerina]]\" and \"[[Slim Slow Slider]]\". Davis expressed to ''Rolling Stone'' that there was a \"certain feel about a seven-to-ten o'clock session\" and that \"the ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played\".<ref name=\"TurnerPage90\"/><ref name=\"HintonPage89\"/> Both \"Sweet Thing\" and \"Ballerina\" were originally scheduled for the session, but the search for a 'closer' consumed a considerable amount of time.  They attempted (and rejected) a number of songs until Morrison suggested  \"Slim Slow Slider\". \"I don't think we'd ever done [it] live\", recalls Payne. \"[Morrison] had a book full of songs&nbsp;... I don't know why he decided to do it&nbsp;... And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van&nbsp;— all of us were playing. Then I started playing soprano sax on the thing, and Lew said, 'OK, I wanna try it again. Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax, and Van.{{'\"}} It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process. Many of the tracks on ''Astral Weeks'' would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on \"Slim Slow Slider\" was easily the most substantial. \"I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff\", says Payne. \"We went through stages [until] we got to be avant-garde kind of weird, which is what you hear after the splice – all that weird stuff we're playing – but there was a whole progression to that.\" According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda \"was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute&nbsp;...

He served with distinction in the Army for four decades, including service in the [[Mexican–American War]] and as a [[Union Army|Union]] [[General (United States)|general]] in the [[American Civil War]]. Known to his Army as \"Hancock the Superb,\" he was noted in particular for his personal leadership at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863.

This concluded with the [[Medicine Lodge Treaty]].

Gen. [[John F. Reynolds]], was killed early on July 1, Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]], the new commander of the Army of the Potomac, sent Hancock ahead to take command of the units on the field and assess the situation. Hancock thus was in temporary command of the \"left wing\" of the army, consisting of the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I]], II, [[III Corps (Union Army)|III]], and [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]]. This demonstrated Meade's high confidence in him, because Hancock was not the most senior Union officer at Gettysburg at the time.<ref>Jordan, p. 81.</ref> Hancock and the more senior XI Corps commander, Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]], argued briefly about this command arrangement, but Hancock prevailed and he organized the Union defenses on [[Cemetery Hill]] as more numerous Confederate forces drove the I and XI Corps back through the town. He had the authority from Meade to withdraw, so he was responsible for the decision to stand and fight at Gettysburg.<ref>Tucker, pp. 131–34</ref> At the conclusion of the day's action, Maj. Gen. [[Henry Warner Slocum]] arrived on the field and assumed command until Gen. Meade arrived after midnight.\n\nOn July 2, Hancock's II Corps was positioned on [[Cemetery Ridge]], roughly in the center of the Union line, while Confederate [[Full General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Robert E.

Gen. (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Lewis A. Armistead]], now leading a brigade in [[Maj. Gen. (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George Pickett]]'s division, was wounded and died two days later. Hancock could not meet with his friend because he had just been wounded himself, a severe wound caused by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail.<ref>Jordan, p. 98.</ref> Helped from his horse by aides, and with a [[tourniquet]] applied to stanch the bleeding, he removed the saddle nail himself and, mistaking its source, remarked wryly, \"They must be hard up for ammunition when they throw such shot as that.\"<ref>Foote, p. 561.</ref> News of Armistead's mortal wounding was brought to Hancock by a member of his staff, Capt. [[Henry H. Bingham]]. Despite his pain, Hancock refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was resolved. He had been an inspiration for his troops throughout the three-day battle.

Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s 1864 [[Overland Campaign]], but he never regained full mobility and his former youthful energy.<ref>Jordan, p. 103.</ref> Nevertheless, he performed well at the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] and commanded a critical breakthrough assault of the Mule Shoe at the \"Bloody Angle\" in the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]] on May 12, shattering the Confederate defenders in his front, including the [[Stonewall Brigade]].<ref>Jordan, pp. 126–33.</ref> His corps suffered enormous losses during a futile assault Grant ordered at [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]].<ref>Jordan, pp. 136–39.</ref>\n\nAfter Grant's army slipped past Lee's army to cross the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], Hancock found himself in a position from which he might have ended the war. His corps arrived to support [[William Farrar Smith]]'s assaults on the lightly held [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] defensive lines, but he deferred to Smith's advice because Smith knew the ground and had been on the field all day, and no significant assaults were made before the Confederate lines were reinforced. One of the great opportunities of the war was lost.<ref name=Cluff/> After his corps participated in the assaults at [[First Battle of Deep Bottom|Deep Bottom]], Hancock was promoted to brigadier general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]], effective August 12, 1864.<ref name=Eicher/>\n\nHancock's only significant military defeat occurred during the [[siege of Petersburg]]. His II Corps moved south of the city, along the [[Wilmington and Weldon Railroad]], tearing up track. On August 25, Confederate Maj. Gen. [[Henry Heth]] attacked and overran the faulty Union position at [[Second Battle of Ream's Station|Reams's Station]], shattering the II Corps, capturing many prisoners.<ref>Jordan, pp. 159–64.</ref> Despite a later victory at [[Battle of Boydton Plank Road|Hatcher's Run]], the humiliation of Reams's Station contributed, along with the lingering effects of his Gettysburg wound, to his decision to give up field command in November.<ref name=jordan169>Jordan, pp. 169–73</ref> He left the II Corps after a year in which it had suffered over 40,000 casualties, but had achieved significant military victories.

[[Philip Sheridan]] in command of forces in the now-quiet [[Shenandoah Valley]].<ref name=Cluff/> He was promoted to brevet major general in the regular army for his service at Spotsylvania, effective March 13, 1865.<ref name=Eicher/>\n\n==Post-war military service==\n\n===Execution of Lincoln assassination conspirators===\n[[File:Execution Lincoln assassins.jpg|thumb|The [[Capital punishment|execution]] of the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln assassination]] conspirators, July 7, 1865]]\nAt the close of the war, Hancock was assigned to supervise the execution of the conspirators in the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination of President Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Jordan, p. 177.</ref> Lincoln had been assassinated on April 14, 1865, and by May 9 of that year, a military commission had been convened to try the accused.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 211–12; Jordan, pp. 176–77.</ref> The actual assassin, [[John Wilkes Booth]], was already dead, but the trial of his co-conspirators proceeded quickly, resulting in convictions. President [[Andrew Johnson]] ordered the executions to be carried out on July 7. Although he was reluctant to execute some of the less-culpable conspirators, especially [[Mary Surratt]], Hancock carried out his orders, later writing that \"every soldier was bound to act as I did under similar circumstances.\"<ref>Jordan, pp. 179–80; Tucker, p. 272.</ref>\n\n===Service on the Plains===\nAfter the executions, Hancock was assigned command of the newly organized [[Middle Military Division|Middle Military Department]], headquartered in [[Baltimore]].<ref>Jordan, p. 182.</ref> In 1866, on Grant's recommendation, Hancock was promoted to major general and was transferred, later that year, to command of the military [[Department of the Missouri]], which included the states of [[Missouri]] and [[Kansas]] and the territories of [[Colorado]] and [[New Mexico]].<ref>Jordan, pp. 183–84.</ref> Hancock reported to [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas, and took up his new posting.\n\nSoon after arriving, he was assigned by General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] to lead an expedition to negotiate with the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Sioux]], with whom relations had worsened since the [[Sand Creek massacre]].<ref>Jordan, pp. 185–89.</ref> The negotiations got off to a bad start, and after Hancock ordered the burning of an abandoned Cheyenne village in central Kansas, relations became worse than when the expedition had started.<ref>Jordan, p. 194; Walker, p. 296.</ref>\n\nThe official report to the President by the [[Indian Peace Commission]] found that the actions of [[George Custer]] and other subordinates just after Hancock's arrival led to an instigation of violent reprisals by the Native Americans:\n\n{{Blockquote\n|text=Orders were then given to surround the village and capture the Indians remaining. The order was obeyed, but the chiefs and warriors had departed. The only persons found were an old Sioux and an idiotic girl of eight or nine years of age. It afterwards appeared that the person of this girl had been violated, from which she soon died. The Indians were gone, and the report spread that she had been a captive among them, and they had committed this outrage before leaving. The Indians say that she was an idiotic Cheyenne girl, forgotten in the confusion of flight, and if violated, it was not by them.\n\nThe next morning General Custer, under orders, stated in pursuit of the Indians with his cavalry, and performed a campaign of great labor and suffering, passing over a vast extent of country, but seeing no hostile Indians. When the fleeing Indians reached the Smoky Hill they destroyed a station and killed several men. A courier having brought this intelligence to General Hancock, he at once ordered the Indian village, of about 300 lodges, together with the entire property of the tribes, to be burned.\n\nThe Indian now became an outlaw -- not only the Cheyennes and Sioux, but all the tribes on the plains. The superintendent of an express company, Cottrell, issued a circular order to the agents and employees of the company in the following language: \"You will hold no communications with Indians whatever. If Indians come within shooting distance, shoot them. Show them no mercy, for they will show you none.\" This was in the Indian country. He closes by saying: \"General Hancock will protect you and our property.\"\n\nWhether war existed previous to that time seems to have been a matter of doubt even with General Hancock himself. From that day forward no doubt on the subject was entertained by anybody. The Indians were then fully aroused, and no more determined war has ever been waged by them. The evidence taken tends to show that we have lost many soldiers, besides a larger number of settlers, on the frontier. The most valuable trains belonging to individuals, as well as to government, among which was a government train of ammunition, were captured by those wild horsemen. Stations were destroyed. Hundreds of horses and mules were taken, and found in their possession when we met them in council; while we are forced to believe that their entire loss since the burning of their village consists of six men killed.\n\nThe Kiowas and Comanches, it will be seen, deny the statement of Jones in every particular. They say that no war party came in at the time stated, or at any other time, after the treaty of 1865. They deny that they killed any Negro soldiers, and positively assert that no Indian was ever known to scalp a Negro. In the latter statement they are corroborated by all the tribes and by persons who know their habits; and the records of the adjutant general's office fail to show the loss of the 17 Negro soldiers, or any soldiers at all. They deny having robbed Jones or insulted Page or Tappan. Tappan's testimony was taken, in which he brands the whole statement of Jones as false, and declares that both he and Page so informed Major Douglas within a few days after Jones made his affidavit. We took the testimony of Major Douglas, in which he admits the correctness of Tappan's statement, but, for some reason unexplained, he failed to communicate the correction to General Hancock. The threats to take the horses and attack the posts on the Arkansas were made in a vein of jocular bravado, and not understood by any one present at the time to possess the least importance. The case of the Box family has already been explained, and this completes the case against the Kiowas and Comanches, who are exculpated by the united testimony of all the tribes from any share in the late troubles.\n\nThe Cheyennes admit that one of their young men in a private quarrel, both parties being drunk, killed a New Mexican at Fort Zarah. Such occurrences are so frequent among the whites on the plains that ignorant Indians might be pardoned for participating, if it be done merely to evidence their advance in civilization. The Indians claim that the Spaniard was in fault, and further protest that no demand was ever made for the delivery of the Indian.\n\nThe Arapahoes admit that a party of their young men, with three young warriors of the Cheyennes, returning from an excursion against the Utes, attacked the train of Mr. Weddell, of New Mexico, during the month of March, and they were gathering up the stock when the war commenced.\n\nThough this recital should prove tedious, it was thought necessary to guard the future against the errors of the past. We would not blunt the vigilance of military men in the Indian country, but we would warn them against the acts of the selfish and unprincipled, who need to be watched as well as the Indian. The origin and progress of this war are repeated in nearly all Indian wars. The history of one will suffice for many.\n\n'''Nor would we be understood as conveying a censure of General Hancock''' [empasis added] for organizing this expedition. He had just come to the department, and circumstances were ingeniously woven to deceive him. His distinguished services in another field of patriotic duty had left him but little time to become acquainted with the remote or immediate causes producing these troubles. If he erred, he can very well roll a part of the responsibility on others; not alone on subordinate commanders, who were themselves deceived by others, but on those who were able to guard against the error and yet failed to do it. We have hundreds of treaties with the Indians, and military posts are situated everywhere on their reservations. Since 1837 these treaties have not been compiled, and no provision is made, when a treaty is proclaimed, to furnish it to the commanders of posts, departments, or divisions. This is the fault of Congress.\n<ref name=\"ipc-report\">Indian Peace Commission 1868</ref>}}\n\n===Reconstruction===\n[[File:Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Johnson]] thought Hancock was the ideal Reconstruction general.]]\nHancock's time in the West was brief. President Johnson, unhappy with the way Republican generals were governing the South under [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], sought replacements for them.<ref>Trefousse, pp. 289–90.</ref> The general who offended Johnson the most was [[Philip Sheridan]], and Johnson soon ordered General Grant to switch the assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson's liking.<ref name=jordan200>Jordan, pp. 200–01.</ref> Although neither man was pleased with the change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to [[New Orleans]].<ref name=jordan200/>\n\nHancock's new assignment found him in charge of the [[Fifth Military District]], covering [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]. Almost immediately upon arriving, Hancock ingratiated himself with the secessionist white population by issuing his General Order Number 40 of November 29, 1867. In that order, written while traveling to New Orleans, Hancock expressed sentiments in support of President Johnson's policies, writing that if the residents of the district conducted themselves peacefully and the civilian officials perform their duties, then \"the military power should cease to lead, and the civil administration resume its natural and rightful dominion.\"<ref>Jamieson, pp. 152–53.</ref> The order continued:\n{{blockquote|The great principles of American liberty are still the lawful inheritance of this people, and ever should be. The right of trial by jury, the habeas corpus, the liberty of the press, the freedom of speech, the natural rights of persons and the rights of property must be preserved. Free institutions, while they are essential to the prosperity and happiness of the people, always furnish the strongest inducements to peace and order.<ref>Jordan, p. 203.</ref>}}\nHancock's order encouraged white Democrats across the South who hoped to return to civilian government more quickly, but discomforted blacks and Republicans in the South who feared a return to the antebellum ways of traditional white dominance.<ref>Jordan, pp. 204–05; Tucker, pp. 279–84.</ref>\n\nHancock's General Order Number 40 was quickly condemned by Republicans in Washington, especially by the [[Radical Republicans|Radicals]], while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved.<ref name=jordan206>Jordan, pp. 206–08; Walker, pp. 301–03.</ref> Heedless of the situation in Washington, Hancock soon put his words into action, refusing local Republican politicians' requests to use his power to overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed.<ref name=jordan206/> Hancock's popularity within the Democratic party grew to the extent that he was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in [[1868 United States presidential election|the 1868 election]].<ref>Jordan, 213–28; Warner, p. 204.</ref> Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went unfulfilled. Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one who believed in the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.<ref>Jordan, p. 212; Walker pp. 301–02.</ref>\n\n===Return to the Plains===\nFollowing [[Ulysses S. Grant|General Grant's]] 1868 presidential victory, the Republicans were firmly in charge in Washington. As a result, Hancock found himself transferred, this time away from the sensitive assignment of reconstructing the South and into the relative backwater that was the [[Department of Dakota]].<ref>Jordan, p. 229.</ref> The Department covered [[Minnesota]], [[Montana Territory|Montana]], and [[Dakota Territory|the Dakotas]]. As in his previous Western command, Hancock began with a conference of the Indian chiefs, but this time was more successful in establishing a peaceful intent.<ref>Jordan, pp. 220–21.</ref> Relations worsened in 1870, however, as an army expedition committed [[Marias massacre|a massacre]] against the [[Blackfoot|Blackfeet]].<ref>Jordan, p. 232.</ref> Relations with the [[Sioux]] also became contentious as a result of white encroachment into the [[Black Hills]], in violation of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]].<ref>Jordan, pp. 233–34.</ref>\n\nIt was during this tour that Hancock had the opportunity to contribute to the creation of [[Yellowstone National Park]]. In August 1870, he ordered the 2nd Cavalry at [[Fort Ellis]] to provide a military escort for General [[Henry D. Washburn]]'s planned exploration of the Yellowstone Region.  The expedition, which was a major impetus in creating the park, became known as the [[Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition]]. Hancock's order led to the assignment of Lt. [[Gustavus Cheyney Doane]] and a troop of 5 cavalrymen from Fort Ellis to escort the expedition.  In 1871, Captain [[John W. Barlow]] during his exploration of the Yellowstone region formally named a summit on what would become the southern boundary of the park [[Mount Hancock (Wyoming)|Mount Hancock]] to honor the general's decision to provide the escort.<ref>{{cite book |last=Whittlesey |first=Lee |title=Yellowstone Place Names |publisher=Wonderland Publishing Company |location=Gardiner, MT |isbn=1-59971-716-6|year=1996 |page=178}}</ref>\n\n===Command in the East and political ambitions===\nIn 1872, [[George Meade|General Meade]] died, leaving Hancock the army's senior major general. This entitled him to a more prominent command, and President Grant, still desirous to keep Hancock from a Southern post, assigned him command of the [[Military Division of the Atlantic|Division of the Atlantic]], headquartered at [[Fort Columbus]] on [[Governors Island]], in [[New York City]].<ref>Jordan, p. 235; Tucker, p. 292.</ref> The vast department covered the settled northeast area of the country and was militarily uneventful with the exception of the army's involvement in the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]]. When railroad workers went on strike to protest wage cuts, the nation's transportation system was paralyzed. The governors of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland asked President Hayes to call in federal troops to re-open the railways. Once federal troops entered the cities, most of the strikers melted away, but there were some violent clashes.<ref>Jordan, pp. 242–50.</ref>\n\nAll the while Hancock was posted in New York, he did his best to keep his political ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' [[1876 Democratic National Convention|1876 convention]], but was never a serious contender as New York governor [[Samuel J. Tilden]] swept the field on the second ballot.<ref>Jordan, p. 239.</ref> The Republican candidate, [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The [[Electoral Commission (United States)|electoral crisis]] of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.<ref>Robinson, Lloyd, ''The Stolen Election: Hayes versus Tilden–1876'', Agberg, Ltd. 1968, pp. 199–213.</ref>\n\n==Election of 1880==\n{{Main|1880 United States presidential election}}\n{| align=right\n!Hancock after the War\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Winfield Scott Hancock - Brady-Handy.jpg\nFile:Winfield Scott Hancock, 1824-86.jpg\n</gallery>\n|}\n\n===Democratic convention===\nHancock's name had been proposed several times for the Democratic nomination for president, but he never captured a majority of delegates. In 1880, however, Hancock's chances improved. President Hayes had promised not to run for a second term, and the previous Democratic nominee, Tilden, declined to run again due to poor health.<ref>Jordan, pp. 255–59.</ref> Hancock faced several competitors for the nomination, including [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], [[Allen G. Thurman]], [[Stephen Johnson Field]], and [[Thomas F. Bayard]]. Hancock's neutrality on the [[Gold standard#The gold exchange standard|monetary question]], and his lingering support in the South (owing to his General Order Number 40) meant that Hancock, more than any other candidate, had nationwide support.<ref>Jordan, p. 262.</ref> When the [[1880 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]] assembled in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] in June 1880, Hancock led on the first ballot, but did not have a majority.<ref name=walker306>Walker, p. 306.</ref> By the second ballot, Hancock received the requisite two-thirds, and [[William Hayden English]] of [[Indiana]] was chosen as his running mate.<ref>Walker, p. 306; Jordan, p. 281.</ref><ref>Tucker, pp. 300–01.</ref>\n\n===Campaign against Garfield===\n[[File:1880DemocraticCampaignPoster.png|thumb|Hancock-English election poster]]\nThe Republicans [[1880 Republican National Convention|nominated]] [[James A. Garfield]], a Congressman from [[Ohio]] and a skillful politician, as well as a former general from the Civil War. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the [[Solid South]], but needed to add a few of the Northern states to their total to win the election. The practical differences between the parties were few, and the Republicans were reluctant to attack Hancock personally because of his heroic reputation.<ref>Jordan, pp. 292–96; Walker, p. 307.</ref> The one policy difference the Republicans were able to exploit was a statement in the Democratic platform endorsing \"a [[Tariff in American history|tariff]] for revenue only.\"<ref>Jordan, p. 297.</ref> Garfield's campaigners used this statement to paint the Democrats as unsympathetic to the plight of industrial laborers, a group that would benefit by a high protective tariff. The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states, which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority.<ref>Jordan, pp. 297–301.</ref> In the end, the Democrats and Hancock failed to carry any of the Northern states they had targeted, with the exception of [[New Jersey]]. Hancock lost the election to Garfield. Garfield polled only 39,213 more votes than Hancock, the popular vote being 4,453,295 for Garfield and 4,414,082 for Hancock. The electoral count, however, had a much larger spread, as Garfield polled 214 electoral votes and Hancock only 155. Garfield would be shot four months into his presidency on July 2, 1881, and would die on September 19, 1881.<ref>Jordan, p. 306.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nHancock took his electoral defeat in stride and attended Garfield's inauguration.<ref>Walker, p. 311.</ref> Following the election, Hancock carried on as commander of the Division of the Atlantic. He was elected president of the [[National Rifle Association]] in 1881, explaining that \"The object of the NRA is to increase the military strength of the country by making skill in the use of arms as prevalent as it was in the days of the Revolution.\"<ref>Kopel, ''National Review''.</ref> Hancock was a Charter Director and the first president of the [[Military Service Institution of the United States]] from 1878 until his death in 1886.<ref>''Constitution, by-laws and register: together with memoranda relating to the history and work of the institution'', Military Service Institution of the United States, Governor's Island, N.Y.H., Wynkoop Hallenbeck Crawford co., 1906.</ref> He was commander-in-chief of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]] veterans organization from 1879 until his death in 1886. He was the author of ''Reports of Major General W. S. Hancock upon Indian Affairs'', published in 1867.<ref name=Eicher/> Hancock's last major public appearance was to preside over the funeral of President Grant in 1885, although he also made a less publicized trip that year to Gettysburg.<ref>Jordan, pp. 312–13.</ref>\n\nHancock died in 1886 at Governors Island, still in command of the Military Division of the Atlantic, the victim of an infected [[carbuncle]], complicated by [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].<ref name=Tagg/><ref name=Cluff/> He is buried in [[Montgomery Cemetery]] in [[West Norriton Township, Pennsylvania]], near [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=Eicher/> Hancock's wife, Almira, published ''Reminiscences of Winfield Scott Hancock'' in 1887.\n\nIn 1893, Republican General [[Francis Amasa Walker|Francis A. Walker]] wrote,<blockquote>Although I did not vote for General Hancock, I am strongly disposed to believe that one of the best things the nation has lost in recent years has been the example and the influence of that chivalric, stately, and splendid gentleman in the [[White House]]. Perhaps much which both parties now recognize as having been unfortunate and mischievous during the past thirteen years would have been avoided had General Hancock been elected.<ref>They Also Ran, Irving Stone, p. 188.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis noted integrity was a counterpoint to the corruption of the era, for as President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] said,<blockquote>If, when we make up our estimate of a public man, conspicuous both as a soldier and in civil life, we are to think first and chiefly of his manhood, his integrity, his purity, his singleness of purpose, and his unselfish devotion to duty, we can truthfully say of Hancock that he was through and through pure gold.<ref>Jordan, p. 319.</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:General Winfield Scott Hancock leading Ulysses S Grant's funeral procession.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|General Winfield Scott Hancock leading Ulysses S. Grant's funeral procession in New York City]]\n\nThe last public act performed by Hancock was his oversight of the funeral of Ulysses S. Grant in 1885, and his organizing and leading of Grant's nine-mile funeral procession in New York City. From Grant's home at Mount McGregor, New York, to its resting place in Riverside Park, the casket containing Grant's remains was in the charge of General Hancock. As he appeared on the scene at the commencement of Grant's funeral procession, Hancock was met with a mild applause, but with a gesture he directed a silence and respect for Grant.<ref>[[#goodrich|Goodrich, 1886]], pp. 333–34</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Smith arch Hancock.jpg|thumb| Statue of Hancock on the [[Smith Memorial Arch]] in Philadelphia]]\n[[File:General Winfield Scott Hancock Memorial.JPG|thumb|upright|[[General Winfield Scott Hancock (Ellicott)|General Winfield Scott Hancock Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nWinfield Scott Hancock is memorialized in a number of statues:\n* An [[equestrian statue]] on East Cemetery Hill on the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]].\n* A [[Winfield Scott Hancock (statue)|portrait statue]] by [[Cyrus Edwin Dallin|Cyrus Dallin]] as part of the Pennsylvania Memorial at Gettysburg.\n* An [[alto-relievo]] representing Hancock's wounding during [[Pickett's Charge]], on the New York State Monument at Gettysburg.\n* An equestrian statue located at [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]] and 7th Street, NW in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n* An equestrian statue atop the [[Smith Memorial Arch]] in [[Fairmount Park]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].\n* A monumental bronze bust in Hancock Square, [[New York City]], by sculptor James Wilson Alexander MacDonald.\n* [[Fort Hancock, Texas]]\n* [[Fort Hancock, New Jersey|Fort Hancock]] on [[Sandy Hook, New Jersey|Sandy Hook]], New Jersey, was named for General Hancock.\nThe original Winfield Scott Hancock Elementary School, located at Arch and East Spruce Streets in Norristown, Pennsylvania, was built in 1895 in memory of the General who grew up not far from the site. It was replaced in 1962 by a new building still in use by the [[Norristown Area School District]] only a few blocks away at Arch and Summit Streets, which is also named after General Hancock.

The [[supernova remnant|remnants]] of more recent supernovae have been found, and observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur in the Milky Way on average about three times every century. A supernova in the Milky Way would almost certainly be observable through modern astronomical telescopes. The most recent naked-eye supernova was [[SN 1987A]], which was the explosion of a [[blue supergiant star]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], a [[satellite galaxy]] of the Milky Way.\n\nTheoretical studies indicate that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a [[white dwarf]], or the sudden [[gravitational collapse]] of a massive star's [[stellar core|core]].\n* In the re-ignition of a white dwarf, the object's temperature is raised enough to trigger [[Thermal runaway|runaway]] nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. Possible causes are an accumulation of material from a [[Binary star|binary companion]] through [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], or by a [[stellar merger]].\n* In the case of a massive star's sudden implosion, the core of a [[stellar evolution#Massive stars|massive star]] will undergo sudden collapse once it is unable to produce sufficient energy from fusion to counteract the star's own gravity, which must happen once the star begins [[alpha process|fusing iron]], but may happen during an earlier stage of [[metallicity|metal]] fusion.\n\nSupernovae can expel several [[solar mass]]es of material at speeds up to several percent of the [[speed of light]]. This drives an expanding [[shock wave]] into the surrounding [[interstellar medium]], sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant. Supernovae are a major source of [[chemical element|elements]] in the interstellar medium from [[oxygen]] to [[rubidium]]. The expanding shock waves of supernovae can trigger the [[star formation|formation of new stars]]. Supernovae are a major source of [[cosmic ray]]s. They might also produce [[gravitational wave]]s.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word ''supernova'' has the [[plural]] form ''supernovae'' ({{IPAc-en|-|v|iː}}) or ''supernovas'' and is often abbreviated as SN or SNe. It is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[nova]]}}, meaning {{gloss|new}}, which refers to what appears to be a temporary new bright star. Adding the prefix \"super-\" distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae, which are far less luminous. The word ''supernova'' was coined by [[Walter Baade]] and [[Fritz Zwicky]], who began using it in astrophysics lectures in 1931.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Zwicky |first=Fritz |date=1 January 1940 |title=Types of Novae |url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.12.66 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |language=en |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=66–85 |bibcode=1940RvMP...12...66Z |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.12.66 |issn=0034-6861}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last=Osterbrock |first=D.

The light curve continues to decline in the [[UBV photometric system|B band]] while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about 40 days, but this is only a hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra-red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it. The visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt (which has the longer half-life and controls the later curve), because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation. After several months, the light curve changes its decline rate again as [[positron emission]] from the remaining cobalt-56 becomes dominant, although this portion of the light curve has been little-studied.<ref name=taubenberger2009>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15478.x |title=Late-time supernova light curves: The effect of internal conversion and Auger electrons |year=2009 |last1=Seitenzahl |first1=I.

The visual light output is again due to radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation, but there is a much lower mass of the created nickel-56. The peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional type Ib/c supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm. The most luminous type Ic supernovae are referred to as [[hypernova]]e and tend to have broadened light curves in addition to the increased peak luminosity. The source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by the formation of a rotating black hole, which also produce gamma-ray bursts.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Tsvetkov |first=D.

The visual light output is dominated by kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several months, due primarily to the existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant progenitor star. In the initial destruction this hydrogen becomes heated and ionised. The majority of type II supernovae show a prolonged plateau in their light curves as this hydrogen recombines, emitting visible light and becoming more transparent. This is then followed by a declining light curve driven by radioactive decay although slower than in type I supernovae, due to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen.<ref name=\"doggett\"/>\n\nIn type II-L the plateau is absent because the progenitor had relatively little hydrogen left in its atmosphere, sufficient to appear in the spectrum but insufficient to produce a noticeable plateau in the light output. In type IIb supernovae the hydrogen atmosphere of the progenitor is so depleted (thought to be due to tidal stripping by a companion star) that the light curve is closer to a type I supernova and the hydrogen even disappears from the spectrum after several weeks.<ref name=\"doggett\"/>\n\nType IIn supernovae are characterised by additional narrow spectral lines produced in a dense shell of circumstellar material. Their light curves are generally very broad and extended, occasionally also extremely luminous and referred to as a superluminous supernova. These light curves are produced by the highly efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the ejecta into electromagnetic radiation by interaction with the dense shell of material. This only occurs when the material is sufficiently dense and compact, indicating that it has been produced by the progenitor star itself only shortly before the supernova occurs.<ref name=fillipenko1997>{{cite journal |bibcode=1997ARA&A..35..309F\n|title=Optical Spectra of Supernovae\n|journal=[[Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics]]\n|volume=35 |pages=309–355\n|last1=Filippenko |first1=A.

Consequently, they may provide information about the core-collapse process that is unavailable by other means. Most gravitational-wave signals predicted by supernova models are short in duration, lasting less than a second, and thus difficult to detect. Using the arrival of a neutrino signal may provide a trigger that can identify the time window in which to seek the gravitational wave, helping to distinguish the latter from background noise.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Al Kharusi |first1=S. |last2=BenZvi |first2=S.

It is likely to be produced by the collapse of an unremarkable red supergiant, and it is very probable that it will already have been catalogued in infrared surveys such as [[2MASS]]. There is a smaller chance that the next core collapse supernova will be produced by a different type of massive star such as a yellow hypergiant, luminous blue variable, or Wolf–Rayet. The chances of the next supernova being a type Ia produced by a white dwarf are calculated to be about a third of those for a core collapse supernova. Again it should be observable wherever it occurs, but it is less likely that the progenitor will ever have been observed. It is not even known exactly what a type Ia progenitor system looks like, and it is difficult to detect them beyond a few parsecs. The total supernova rate in the Milky Way is estimated to be between 2 and 12 per century, although one has not actually been observed for several centuries.<ref name=\"adams\">\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Adams |first1=S.

      "reference_summary": "A supernova is a stellar explosion characterized by extreme luminosity, outshining entire galaxies temporarily. Occurring during the final evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, supernovae leave behind neutron stars or black holes. The last naked-eye supernova observed in our galaxy was Kepler's Supernova in 1604; the most recent one visible without a telescope was SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Supernovae are primarily caused by two mechanisms: re-ignition of nuclear fusion in white dwarfs or gravitational collapse of massive stars' cores. These events expel vast amounts of material into space, enriching the interstellar medium with elements crucial for star formation and contributing to cosmic rays and possibly gravitational waves. The term \"supernova\" was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s to distinguish these phenomena from less luminous novae. Supernovae play a critical role in galactic evolution by dispersing heavy elements and triggering new star formation.",
      "base_model_summary": "Supernovae are powerful and luminous explosions of stars that occur during their final evolutionary stages or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. These explosions can result in the collapse of the progenitor into a neutron star or black hole, or its complete destruction to form a diffuse nebula. The peak luminosity of a supernova can match that of an entire galaxy before fading over weeks or months. Historically, the last supernova observed in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, with more recent observations in other galaxies suggesting an average occurrence of about three times per century in our galaxy. The mechanisms behind supernovae include the re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a white dwarf or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. Supernovae expel several solar masses of material at high speeds, creating expanding shock waves that drive new star formation and contribute to the interstellar medium with various elements. They are also a major source of cosmic rays and may produce gravitational waves. The term \"supernova\" was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1931 to differentiate these events from ordinary novae. Summary: Supernovae are powerful, luminous stellar explosions occurring during the final stages of a star's life or when a white dwarf undergoes runaway fusion. These events can lead to the formation of neutron stars, black holes, or diffuse nebulae, with peak luminosities comparable to entire galaxies. Historically, the last visible supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, while more recent observations suggest an average occurrence rate of about three times per century. The primary mechanisms include fusion re-ignition in white dwarfs or core collapse in massive stars. Supernovae eject significant material at high speeds, creating shock waves that contribute elements, drive star formation, and produce cosmic rays. They may also generate gravitational waves. The term \"supernova\" was introduced by Baade and Zwicky in 1931 to distinguish these phenomena from ordinary novae. Summary: Supernovae are intense, bright explosions marking the end stages of massive stars or runaway white dwarf fusion. They can form neutron stars, black holes, or nebulae, with peak brightnesses rivaling entire galaxies. The last visible supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's in 1604, with an estimated three occurrences per century elsewhere. Key triggers include white dwarf fusion or massive star core collapse. Supernovae eject vast amounts of material at high speeds",

Summary in French: Les supernovas sont des explosions puissantes et lumineuses de étoiles se produisant lors des dernières étapes de l'évolution stellaire ou lorsque une étoile blanche est déclenchée dans une fusion nucléaire incontrôlée. Elles peuvent entraîner la chute de l'objet précurseur en étoile à neutrons ou en trou noir, ou sa destruction pour former une nébuleuse diffuse. La luminosité maximale d'une supernova peut correspondre à celle d'une galaxie entière avant de se dissiper sur des semaines ou des mois. La dernière supernova visible à l'œil nu dans la Voie Lactée était celle de Kepler en 1604, avec des restes observables par des télescopes modernes. Les supernovas sont provoquées soit par la réactivation soudaine de la fusion nucléaire dans une étoile blanche, soit par la chute soudaine du noyau d'une étoile massive. Elles expulsent plusieurs masses solaires de matière à des vitesses élevées, générant des vagues de choc dans l'espace interstellaire et contribuant à la formation de nouvelles étoiles. Les supernovas sont une importante source de éléments chimiques et de rayons cosmiques, et peuvent produire",

The film tells the story of [[Ron Woodroof]] ([[Matthew McConaughey]]), a cowboy diagnosed with [[AIDS]] in the mid-1980s, a time when both the [[etiology]] and the treatment of [[HIV]]/AIDS are poorly understood and its sufferers subject to [[Social stigma|stigmatization]]. As part of an ongoing experimental AIDS treatment movement, Woodroof smuggles unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas to treat his symptoms. Here, he distributes them to fellow people with AIDS by establishing the \"Dallas Buyers Club\", all the while facing opposition from the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). Two fictional supporting characters, Dr. Eve Saks ([[Jennifer Garner]]), and Rayon ([[Jared Leto]]), were composite roles created from interviews with transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors. Presidential biographer and PEN-USA winner [[Bill Minutaglio]] wrote the first magazine profile of the Dallas Buyers Club in 1992. The article, which featured interviews with Woodroof and also recreated his dramatic international exploits, attracted widespread attention from filmmakers and journalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10612550/Dallas-Buyers-Club-The-not-so-straight-truth.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10612550/Dallas-Buyers-Club-The-not-so-straight-truth.html |archive-date=January 11, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Dallas Buyers Club: The not-so-straight truth|first=Alex|last=Hannaford|date=February 7, 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\nScreenwriter Borten interviewed Woodroof in 1992 and wrote the script, which he polished with writer Wallack in 2000, and then sold to producer [[Robbie Brenner]]. Several other actors, directors, and producers were attached at various times to the development of the film, but left the project. [[Universal Pictures]] also tried to make the film, but did not. A couple of screenwriters wrote drafts that were rejected. In 2009, producer Brenner involved Matthew McConaughey because of his Texas origins, the same as Woodroof's. Brenner selected the first draft, written by Borten and Wallack, for the film and then Vallée was set to direct. [[Principal photography]] began in November 2012 in [[New Orleans]], continuing for 25 days of filming, which also included shooting in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. Brenner and [[Rachel Winter]] co-produced the film. The official soundtrack album featured various artists, and was released digitally on October 29, 2013, by the [[Relativity Music Group]].\n\n''Dallas Buyers Club'' premiered at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was released theatrically in the United States on November 1, 2013, by [[Focus Features]], entering wide release on November 22. The film grossed over $55 million worldwide against a budget of $5 million. The film received widespread critical acclaim, resulting in [[List of accolades received by Dallas Buyers Club|numerous accolades]]. Critics praised the performances of McConaughey and Leto, who respectively received the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] and the  [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] at the [[86th Academy Awards]], making this the first film since ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'' (2003), and only the fifth film ever to win both awards. The film won the award for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]] and garnered nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]], and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1985, promiscuous [[Dallas]] electrician and rodeo cowboy [[Ron Woodroof]] is diagnosed with [[HIV/AIDS]] and told that he has about 30 days to live. At first, he refuses to accept the diagnosis until he remembers having unprotected sex with a prostitute who was an [[drug injection|intravenous drug]] user. Woodroof's family and friends ostracize him, mistakenly assuming he contracted AIDS from gay sex. He is fired from his job and evicted from his home. His doctor, Eve Saks, tells him an [[antiretroviral drug]] called [[zidovudine]] (AZT)—the only drug yet approved for testing in human [[clinical trials]] by the [[FDA]]—is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients. Saks informs him that half of the trial patients receive the drug and the other half a [[placebo]] since this is the only way to determine if the drug works.\n\nWoodroof bribes a hospital worker to get him AZT, which, exacerbated by his [[cocaine]] and alcohol abuse, causes his health to deteriorate. Recuperating in the hospital, he meets Rayon, a drug-addicted, HIV-positive [[trans woman]] he is initially hostile toward. As his health worsens, he drives to a makeshift Mexican hospital to get more AZT. The facility is run by an American, Dr. Vass, whose medical license was revoked because his work with people with AIDS had violated US regulations. Vass warns Woodroof against AZT, telling him it is \"poisonous.\" Instead, he prescribes a cocktail of drugs and nutritional supplements centered on [[Zalcitabine|ddC]] and the protein [[peptide T]], which are not yet approved for use in the United States by the FDA. Three months later, Woodroof finds his health much improved and realizes he could make money by importing the drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. He is able to get the drugs over the border by masquerading as a priest with cancer and claiming they are for personal use. Dr. Saks starts to notice the adverse effects of AZT, but her supervisor, Dr. Sevard, tells her the trials cannot be discontinued.\n\nWoodroof starts selling the drugs in Dallas on the street, at [[gay nightclub]]s, and [[discotheque]] bars. He reluctantly partners with Rayon since she can bring in more customers. The pair establishes the Dallas Buyers Club, charging $400 per month for membership and giving away the drugs to members to circumvent the laws that made it illegal to sell the drugs. The club is extremely popular, and Woodroof gradually begins to respect Rayon as a friend. When Woodroof is hospitalized for a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] caused by an overdose of recently acquired [[interferon]] from Japan, Dr. Sevard learns of the club and its alternative drugs and is angry that the buyers club is interfering with his trial. The FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Dr. Saks agrees that there are benefits to [[buyers club|clubs]] for HIV drugs but feels powerless to change anything. The process the FDA uses to research, test, and [[Approved drug#United States|approve drugs]] is considered flawed and part of the problem for people suffering from AIDS. At that time, the United States and the FDA were particularly conservative by international standards in testing and approving anti-AIDS drugs. They were hostile to imported drugs to the point they were made contraband.<ref name=\"cma\">{{Cite journal |last=Singer |first=Merrill |date=1994-10-01 |title=Aids and the health crisis of the U.S. urban poor; the perspective of critical medical anthropology |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536%2894%2990205-4 |journal=Social Science & Medicine |language=en |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=931–948 |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(94)90205-4 |pmid=7992126 |issn=0277-9536|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.7720 }}</ref> Dr. Saks and Woodroof begin a friendship.\n\nThe FDA gets a warrant to raid the Buyers Club but can do nothing but fine Woodroof. The FDA changes its regulations in 1987, making any unapproved drug illegal. With the club strapped for cash, Rayon begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her [[life insurance]] policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico to get more peptide T. Upon his return, he finds that Rayon has died in the hospital and is extremely upset by her death. Dr. Saks is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she has been sending patients to the buyers club, but she refuses and insists they will have to fire her instead.\n\nAfter Rayon's death, Woodroof begins to show more compassion toward LGBT members of the club, and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority becomes providing the drugs as peptide T gets increasingly challenging to acquire. Woodroof files a lawsuit against the FDA in late 1987, seeking the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as nontoxic but is still not FDA-approved. The judge is sympathetic toward him and admonishes the FDA but lacks the power to do anything. The FDA later allows Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use. He dies of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially had predicted.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Dallas Buyers Club 08 (9765736361).jpg|175px|thumbnail|right|alt=A profile picture of a middle-aged man with brown color, smiling at something.|McConaughey at the [[2013 Toronto International Film Festival]] premiere]]\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as [[Ron Woodroof]],<ref name=\"casting1\" /> a real-life person with [[AIDS]] who smuggled unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas when he found them effective at improving his symptoms.

By the mid-1990s, [[David Ho (scientist)|David Ho]] and other researchers found AZT was quite effective when used in conjunction with two other anti-virals, which decreased the chances of virus developing resistance to any one drug.<ref name=\"Matthews\"/><ref name=\"cma\"/>\n\nThe treatments that Woodroof did promote were less-effective at best, or at worst, dangerous. According to Staley, Woodroof became a proponent of [[Peptide T]], a treatment which \"never panned out. It's a useless therapy, and it never got approved, and nobody uses it today, but the film implies that it helped him.\"<ref name=\"Matthews\"/> [[Zalcitabine|DDC]], also promoted by Woodroof, did prove to be an effective antiviral treatment, but it also proved to have worse side effects than AZT, with the potential to cause irreversible nerve damage in some cases. As a result, it was only used by doctors for a relatively short time.<ref name=\"Matthews\"/> A third treatment promoted by Woodroof, called Compound Q ([[Trichosanthin]]), was specifically linked to two deaths during trials, and therefore, was not used by doctors thereafter. Most \"buyers clubs\" stopped providing it as well, but Woodroof continued to dispense it, part of the reason for Woodroof's conflict with the FDA.<ref name=\"Matthews\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://focusfeatures.com/dallasbuyersclub}}\n* {{IMDb title|0790636|Dallas Buyers Club}}\n* {{Mojo title|dallasbuyersclub}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|dallas_buyers_club_2013}}\n* {{Metacritic film|title=Dallas Buyers Club}}\n* {{TCMDb title|962553|Dallas-Buyers-Club}}\n\n{{Jean-Marc Vallée}}\n{{Portal bar|Film|United States|LGBTQ}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dallas Buyers Club}}\n[[Category:2013 biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:2013 independent films]]\n[[Category:2013 films]]\n[[Category:American biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:American independent films]]\n[[Category:American LGBTQ-related films]]\n[[Category:Lionsgate Canada films]]\n[[Category:Voltage Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jean-Marc Vallée]]\n[[Category:Drama films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films based on newspaper and magazine articles]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actor Academy Award–winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award–winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Drama Actor Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films set in Dallas]]\n[[Category:Films set in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Films set in the 1990s]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Orleans]]\n[[Category:Films that won the Academy Award for Best Makeup]]\n[[Category:Focus Features films]]\n[[Category:Cross-dressing in American films]]\n[[Category:HIV/AIDS in American films]]\n[[Category:2010s LGBTQ-related drama films]]\n[[Category:LGBTQ-related films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:2013 LGBTQ-related films]]\n[[Category:2013 drama films]]\n[[Category:Films about gender]]\n[[Category:Films about anti-LGBTQ sentiment]]\n[[Category:Films about disability in the United States]]\n[[Category:Films about trans women]]\n[[Category:Advertising and marketing controversies in film]]\n[[Category:LGBTQ-related controversies in film]]\n[[Category:Casting controversies in film]]\n[[Category:2010s English-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s American films]]\n[[Category:English-language biographical drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language independent films]]",

They first appeared during the [[Triassic]] [[Geological period|period]], between 243 and 233.23&nbsp;[[million years ago]] (mya), although the exact origin and timing of the [[#Evolutionary history|evolution of dinosaurs]] is a subject of active research. They became the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s after the [[Triassic–Jurassic extinction event]] 201.3&nbsp;mya and their dominance continued throughout the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. The [[fossil]] record shows that [[bird]]s are [[feathered dinosaur]]s, [[Evolution of birds|having evolved]] from earlier [[Theropoda|theropods]] during the [[Late Jurassic]] [[epoch]], and are the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] approximately 66&nbsp;mya. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into '''avian dinosaurs'''—birds—and the extinct '''non-avian dinosaurs''', which are all dinosaurs other than birds.\n\nDinosaurs are varied from [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]], [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[ecological]] standpoints. Birds, at over 11,000 living [[species]], are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. Using fossil evidence, [[paleontologists]] have identified over 900 distinct [[genera]] and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both [[Neontology|extant]] species (birds) and fossil remains. Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]. Most [[Dinosaur renaissance|research conducted since the 1970s]], however, has indicated that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated [[metabolism]]s and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some were [[herbivorous]], others [[carnivorous]]. Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were [[egg-laying]], and that [[nest]]-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian.\n\nWhile dinosaurs were ancestrally [[bipedal]], many [[extinct]] groups included [[quadrupedal]] species, and some were able to shift between these stances. Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed [[skeletal]] modifications such as [[Armour (anatomy)|bony armor]] and [[spine (zoology)|spines]]. While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied—the largest [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of {{convert|39.7|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and heights of {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} and were the largest land animals of all time. The misconception that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is based in part on [[preservation bias]], as large, sturdy [[bone]]s are more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small, some measuring about {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length.\n\nThe first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, with the name \"dinosaur\" (meaning \"terrible lizard\") being coined by Sir [[Richard Owen]] in 1842 to refer to these \"great fossil lizards\".<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web |date=2017-04-28 |title=The 'birth' of dinosaurs |url=https://morethanadodo.com/2017/04/28/the-birth-of-dinosaurs/ |access-date=2023-03-15 |website=More Than A Dodo |archive-date=March 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230314201255/https://morethanadodo.com/2017/04/28/the-birth-of-dinosaurs/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news |date=October 16, 2015 |title=The Birth of Dinosaurs: Richard Owen and Dinosauria |url=https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2015/10/the-birth-of-dinosaurs-richard-owen-and-dinosauria.html |access-date=March 15, 2023 |website=Biodiversity Heritage Library |archive-date=March 14, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230314201310/https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2015/10/the-birth-of-dinosaurs-richard-owen-and-dinosauria.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book |last1=Brett-Surman |first1=M.

The large sizes of some dinosaurs, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured their regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as the ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' franchise. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.\n\n==Definition==\nUnder [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of the [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA) of ''[[Triceratops]]'' and [[Bird#Diversification of modern birds|modern birds]] (Neornithes), and all its descendants.<ref name=MJB04dino/> It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the MRCA of ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' and ''[[Iguanodon]]'', because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria.<ref name=olshevsky2000/> Both definitions cover the same known genera: Dinosauria = [[Ornithischia]] + [[Saurischia]]. This includes major groups such as [[ankylosauria]]ns (armored herbivorous quadrupeds), [[stegosauria]]ns (plated herbivorous quadrupeds), [[ceratopsia]]ns (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores with [[neck frill]]s), [[pachycephalosauria]]ns (bipedal herbivores with thick skulls), [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]]s (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including \"[[Hadrosauridae|duck-bills]]\"), [[Theropoda|theropod]]s (mostly bipedal carnivores and birds), and [[sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorphs]] (mostly large herbivorous quadrupeds with long necks and tails).<ref name=\"Letal05\"/>\n\nBirds are the sole surviving dinosaurs. In traditional [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], birds were considered a separate [[class (biology)|class]] that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct [[superorder]]. However, most contemporary paleontologists reject the traditional style of classification based on anatomical similarity, in favor of [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] taxonomy based on deduced ancestry, in which each group is defined as all descendants of a given founding genus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |url-status=live |title=Using the tree for classification |website=Understanding Evolution |publisher=[[University of California]] |location=[[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831003846/https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 |archive-date=August 31, 2019 |access-date=October 14, 2019}}</ref> Birds belong to the dinosaur subgroup [[Maniraptora]], which are [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]], which are theropods, which are saurischians.<ref name=KP04/>\n\nResearch by Matthew G. Baron, [[David B. Norman]], and Paul M. Barrett in 2017 suggested a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics. Phylogenetic analysis by Baron ''et al.'' recovered the Ornithischia as being closer to the Theropoda than the Sauropodomorpha, as opposed to the traditional union of theropods with sauropodomorphs. This would cause sauropods and kin to fall outside traditional dinosaurs, so they re-defined Dinosauria as the last common ancestor of ''Triceratops horridus'', ''[[house sparrow|Passer domesticus]]'' and ''[[Diplodocus|Diplodocus carnegii]]'', and all of its descendants, to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs.

Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical for Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to their descendants.

Some of these are also present in [[Silesauridae|silesaurids]], which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria, including a large anterior trochanter, metatarsals II and IV of subequal length, reduced contact between ischium and pubis, the presence of a cnemial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus, and many others.<ref name=MJB04dino/>\n\n[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horizontal.svg|thumb|Hip joints and hindlimb postures of: (left to right) typical [[reptile]]s (sprawling), dinosaurs and [[mammal]]s (erect), and [[rauisuchia]]ns (pillar-erect)]]\n\nA variety of other skeletal features are shared by dinosaurs. However, because they either are common to other groups of archosaurs or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as [[diapsid]]s, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of [[Infratemporal fenestra]]e (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the [[antorbital fenestra|snout]] and lower jaw.<ref name=TRHJ00/> Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups.

As clarified by British geologist and historian Hugh Torrens, Owen had given a presentation about fossil reptiles to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1841, but reports of the time show that Owen did not mention the word \"dinosaur\", nor recognize dinosaurs as a distinct group of reptiles in his address.

(Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named ''[[Hadrosaurus|Hadrosaurus foulkii]]''. It was an extremely important find: ''Hadrosaurus'' was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found ([[Iguanodon#Gideon Mantell, Sir Richard Owen, and the discovery of dinosaurs|the first]] was in 1834, in [[Maidstone|Maidstone, England]]), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of interests in dinosaurs in the United States, known as dinosaur mania.<ref name=weishampel06>{{cite journal |last1=Prieto-Marquez |first1=Albert |last2=Weishampel |first2=David B. |last3=Horner |first3=John R. |date=March 2006 |title=The dinosaur ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'', from the Campanian of the East Coast of North America, with a reevaluation of the genus |url=https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Acta Palaeontologica Polonica |location=Warsaw |publisher=Institute of Paleobiology, Polish Academy of Sciences |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=77–98 |issn=0567-7920 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190622113255/https://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app51/app51-077.pdf |archive-date=June 22, 2019 |access-date=November 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the [[Bone Wars]]. This fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used [[dynamite]] to unearth bones. Modern paleontologists would find such methods crude and unacceptable, since blasting easily destroys fossil and stratigraphic evidence. Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City, while Marsh's is at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] at [[Yale University]].<ref name=Holmes/>\n\n===\"Dinosaur renaissance\" and beyond===\n{{Main|Dinosaur renaissance}}\n[[World War II]] caused a pause in palaeontological research; after the war, research attention was also diverted increasingly to fossil mammals rather than dinosaurs, which were seen as sluggish and cold-blooded.<ref name=\"taylor2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=M.P. |title=Sauropod dinosaur research: a historical review |journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications |year=2010 |volume=343 |issue=1 |pages=361–386 |doi=10.1144/SP343.22|bibcode=2010GSLSP.343..361T |s2cid=910635 }}</ref><ref name=\"Naish\">{{cite book |last=Naish |first=D. |year=2009 |title=The Great Dinosaur Discoveries |pages=89–93 |publisher=A & C Black Publishers Ltd. |location=London, UK |isbn=978-1-4081-1906-8}}</ref> At the end of the 1960s, however, the field of dinosaur research experienced a surge in activity that remains ongoing.<ref name=\"arbour2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Arbour |first1=V. |year=2018 |title=Results roll in from the dinosaur renaissance |journal=Science |volume=360 |issue=6389 |pages=611 |doi=10.1126/science.aat0451|bibcode=2018Sci...360..611A |s2cid=46887409 }}</ref> Several seminal studies led to this activity.

Early sauropodomorphs did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract.<ref name=FS04/> The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of [[ceratosauria]]ns, [[Megalosauroidea|megalosauroids]], and [[Allosauroidea|allosauroids]], and herbivores consisting of stegosaurian ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the [[Morrison Formation]] of [[North America]] and [[Tendaguru Formation|Tendaguru Beds]] of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''.<ref name=HCL04/> Ankylosaurians and ornithopods were also becoming more common, but primitive sauropodomorphs had become extinct. Conifers and [[pteridophyte]]s were the most common plants. Sauropods, like earlier sauropodomorphs, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential [[cheek]]-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food.<ref name=FS04/> Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from maniraptoran coelurosaurians.<ref name=KP04/>\n\nBy the [[Early Cretaceous]] and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, [[iguanodontia]]ns, and [[brachiosauridae|brachiosaurids]] through Europe, North America, and northern [[Africa]]. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large spinosaurid and [[carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] theropods, and [[rebbachisauridae|rebbachisaurid]] and [[titanosauria]]n sauropods, also found in [[South America]]. In [[Asia]], maniraptoran coelurosaurians like dromaeosaurids, [[troodontidae|troodontids]], and [[oviraptorosauria]]ns became the common theropods, and [[ankylosauridae|ankylosaurids]] and early ceratopsians like ''Psittacosaurus'' became important herbivores. Meanwhile, [[Australia]] was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, [[hypsilophodont]]s, and iguanodontians.<ref name=HCL04/> The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early [[Late Cretaceous]]. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of [[flowering plant]]s. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with [[Dinosaur tooth#Dental batteries|dental batteries]], taken to its extreme in hadrosaurids.<ref name=FS04/> Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid ''[[Nigersaurus]]''.<ref name=serenoetal07/>\n\nThere were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were tyrannosaurids and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and pachycephalosaurians. In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting supercontinent [[Gondwana]], [[abelisauridae|abelisaurids]] were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids, [[rhabdodontidae|rhabdodontid]] iguanodontians, [[nodosauridae|nodosaurid]] ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent.<ref name=HCL04/> Flowering plants were greatly radiating,<ref name=FS04/> with the first grasses appearing by the end of the Cretaceous.<ref name=PSAS05/> Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became very diverse across North America and Asia. Theropods were also radiating as herbivores or [[omnivore]]s, with [[Therizinosauria|therizinosaur]]ians and [[ornithomimosauria]]ns becoming common.<ref name=FS04/>\n\nThe Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which occurred approximately 66&nbsp;million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous, caused the extinction of all dinosaur groups except for the neornithine birds. Some other diapsid groups, including [[crocodilia]]ns, [[Dyrosauridae|dyrosaurs]], [[sebecosuchia]]ns, turtles, [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[Rhynchocephalia|sphenodontia]]ns, and [[choristodera]]ns, also survived the event.<ref name=AF04/>\n\nThe surviving lineages of neornithine birds, including the ancestors of modern [[ratite]]s, [[Fowl|ducks and chickens]], and a variety of [[Charadriiformes|waterbirds]], diversified rapidly at the beginning of the [[Paleogene]] period, entering [[ecological niche]]s left vacant by the extinction of Mesozoic dinosaur groups such as the arboreal [[enantiornithine]]s, aquatic [[hesperornithine]]s, and even the larger terrestrial theropods (in the form of ''[[Gastornis]]'', [[Eogruidae|eogruiids]], [[bathornithids]], ratites, [[Geranoididae|geranoidids]], [[mihirung]]s, and \"[[terror bird]]s\"). It is often stated that mammals out-competed the neornithines for dominance of most terrestrial niches but many of these groups co-existed with rich mammalian faunas for most of the [[Cenozoic]] Era.<ref name=lindow>{{harvnb|Dyke|Kaiser|2011|loc=chpt. 14: \"Bird Evolution Across the K–Pg Boundary and the Basal Neornithine Diversification\" by Bent E.

Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodilians sprawl out to either side.<ref name=\"B012\"/>\n\nCollectively, dinosaurs as a clade are divided into two primary branches, Saurischia and Ornithischia. Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all [[taxon|taxa]] sharing a more recent common ancestor with ''Triceratops'' than with Saurischia. Anatomically, these two groups can be distinguished most noticeably by their [[pelvis|pelvic]] structure. Early saurischians—\"lizard-hipped\", from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc-Latn|sauros}}'' ({{lang|grc|σαῦρος}}) meaning \"lizard\" and ''{{lang|grc-Latn|ischion}}'' ({{lang|grc|ἰσχίον}}) meaning \"hip joint\"—retained the hip structure of their ancestors, with a pubis bone directed [[anatomical terms of location|cranially]], or forward.<ref name=MJB00/> This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups (''Herrerasaurus'',<ref name=GSP88/> therizinosauroids,<ref name=clarketal2004/> dromaeosaurids,<ref name=MAPM04/> and birds<ref name=KP04/>). Saurischia includes the theropods (exclusively bipedal and with a wide variety of diets) and sauropodomorphs (long-necked herbivores which include advanced, quadrupedal groups).<ref name=theropods/><ref name=sauropodomorphs>{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Michael P. |author-link1=Michael P.

Unlike birds, the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward-pointing process. Ornithischia includes a variety of species that were primarily herbivores.\n\nDespite the terms \"bird hip\" (Ornithischia) and \"lizard hip\" (Saurischia), birds are not part of Ornithischia.

Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals.

There is general agreement that some behaviors that are common in birds, as well as in [[crocodilian]]s (closest living relatives of birds), were also common among extinct dinosaur groups. Interpretations of behavior in fossil species are generally based on the pose of skeletons and their [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], [[computer simulation]]s of their biomechanics, and comparisons with modern animals in similar ecological niches.<ref name=alexander2006/>\n\nThe first potential evidence for [[herd]]ing or [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]] as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups in addition to birds was the 1878 discovery of 31&nbsp;''Iguanodon'', ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in [[Bernissart]], [[Belgium]], after they fell into a deep, flooded [[sinkhole]] and drowned.<ref name=Yans/> Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-billed (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the [[American bison]] or the African [[springbok]]. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in [[Oxfordshire]], England,<ref name=Day2002/> although there is no evidence for specific herd structures.<ref name=JLW05/> Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense, for [[Bird migration|migratory]] purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in [[Inner Mongolia]] that has yielded remains of over 20 ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'', from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud.<ref name=DVetal08sino/> The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as [[pack hunter]]s working together to bring down large prey.<ref name=LG93/><ref name=\"maxwell&ostrom1995\"/> However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds, crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the [[taphonomy|taphonomic]] evidence suggesting mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as ''Deinonychus'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'' can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.<ref name=RB07/>\n\n[[File:Centrosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Restoration of two ''[[Centrosaurus|Centrosaurus apertus]]'' engaged in [[intra-specific combat]]]]\nThe crests and frills of some dinosaurs, like the [[marginocephalia]]ns, theropods and [[Lambeosaurinae|lambeosaurine]]s, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and [[territory (animal)|territorialism]]. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.<ref name=PC98/>\n\nFrom a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in 1971. It included a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' attacking a ''[[Protoceratops]]'',<ref name=AMNH/> providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other.<ref name=carpenter1998/> Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived.<ref name=carpenter1998/> [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in [[Madagascar]] in 2003, involving the theropod ''[[Majungasaurus]]''.<ref name=rogersetal2003/>\n\nComparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral rings]] of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids, ''[[Juravenator]]'', and ''[[Megapnosaurus]]'' were likely [[nocturnal]]. Large and medium-sized herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs such as ceratopsians, sauropodomorphs, hadrosaurids, ornithomimosaurs may have been [[cathemeral]], active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small ornithischian ''[[Agilisaurus]]'' was inferred to be [[Diurnality|diurnal]].<ref name=SchmitzMotani2011/>\n\nBased on fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as ''[[Oryctodromeus]]'', some ornithischian species seem to have led a partially [[fossorial]] (burrowing) lifestyle.<ref name=VMK07/> Many modern birds are [[arboreal]] (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines.<ref>{{harvnb|Chiappe|Witmer|2002}}</ref> While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including dromaeosaurids) such as ''Microraptor''<ref name=chatterjee2007/>) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, pioneered by [[Robert McNeill Alexander]], has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run,<ref name=alexander2006/> whether [[diplodocid]]s could create [[sonic boom]]s via [[whip]]-like tail snapping,<ref name=goriely/> and whether sauropods could float.<ref name=Henderson2006/>\n\n===Communication===\nModern birds [[Animal communication|communicate]] by visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails, and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology.<ref name=senter2008/> Reconstruction of the plumage color of ''Anchiornis'' suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Li2010\"/> Vocalization in non-avian dinosaurs is less certain. In birds, the [[larynx]] plays no role in sound production. Instead, birds vocalize with a novel organ, the [[Syrinx (bird anatomy)|syrinx]], farther down the trachea.<ref name=\":22\"/> The earliest remains of a syrinx were found in a specimen of the duck-like ''[[Vegavis|Vegavis iaai]]'' dated 69 –66&nbsp;million years ago, and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Clarke2016\"/> \n[[File:Lambeosaurus magnicristatus DB.jpg|thumb|Restoration of a striking and unusual visual display in a ''[[Lambeosaurus|Lambeosaurus magnicristatus]]''. The crest may also have acted as a resonating chamber for sounds.]]\n\nOn the basis that non-avian dinosaurs did not have syrinxes and that their next close living relatives, crocodilians, use the larynx, Phil Senter, a paleontologist, has suggested that the non-avians could not vocalize, because the common ancestor would have been mute. He states that they mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal sounds, such as hissing, jaw-grinding or -clapping, splashing, and wing-beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs).<ref name=senter2008/> Other researchers have countered that vocalizations also exist in turtles, the closest relatives of archosaurs, suggesting that the trait is ancestral to their lineage. In addition, vocal communication in dinosaurs is indicated by the development of advanced hearing in nearly all major groups. Hence the syrinx may have supplemented and then replaced the larynx as a vocal organ, without a \"silent period\" in bird evolution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2023, a fossilized larynx was described, from a specimen of the ankylosaurid ''[[Pinacosaurus]]''. The structure was composed of [[cricoid cartilage|cricoid]] and [[arytenoid cartilage]]s, similar to those of non-avian reptiles; but the mobile cricoid–arytenoid joint and long arytenoid cartilages would have allowed air-flow control similar to that of birds, and thus could have made bird-like vocalizations. In addition, the cartilages were [[ossification|ossified]], implying that laryngeal ossification is a feature of some non-avian dinosaurs.<ref name=\":1\" /> A 2016 study concludes that some dinosaurs may have produced closed-mouth vocalizations, such as cooing, hooting, and booming. These occur in both reptiles and birds and involve inflating the esophagus or tracheal pouches. Such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size.<ref name=\"Tobias2016\"/> The crests of some hadrosaurids and the nasal chambers of ankylosaurids may have been [[acoustic resonance|resonators]].<ref name=\"Weishampel981\"/><ref name=\"Witmer\"/>\n\n===Reproductive biology===\n{{see also|Dinosaur egg}}\n[[File:Gniazdo sieweczki RB.JPG|left|thumb|alt=Three bluish eggs with black speckling sit atop a layer of white mollusk shell pieces, surrounded by sandy ground and small bits of bluish stone|Nest of a [[plover]] (''[[Charadrius]]'')]]\n\nAll dinosaurs laid [[Amniote|amniotic egg]]s.

Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional [[oviduct]] and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as ''[[Troodon]]'', exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying [[Broodiness#Broodiness in non-avian animals|brooding]] until all eggs were laid.<ref name=\"Varrichioetal.02\">{{cite journal |last1=Varricchio |first1=David J. |last2=Horner |first2=John R. |last3=Jackson |first3=Frankie D. |year=2002 |title=Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |location=Milton Park, Oxfordshire |publisher=Taylor & Francis for the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=564–576 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2 |s2cid=85728452 |issn=0272-4634}}</ref>\n\nWhen laying eggs, females grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of their limbs. This medullary bone, which is rich in [[calcium]], is used to make eggshells. A discovery of features in a ''Tyrannosaurus'' skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur ''Allosaurus'' and the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes ''Allosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' diverged from the line that led to ''Tenontosaurus'' very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.<ref name=LW08/>\n[[File:Citipati AMNH.jpg|thumb|Fossil interpreted as a nesting [[oviraptoridae|oviraptorid]] ''[[Citipati]]'' at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. ]]\nAnother widespread trait among modern birds (but see below in regards to fossil groups and extant [[megapodes]]) is parental care for young after hatching.

This was used to imply that the ancient dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, even though many modern reptiles are fast and light-footed despite relying on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. The idea of dinosaurs as ectothermic remained a prevalent view until [[Robert T. Bakker]], an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968. Bakker specifically used anatomical and ecological evidence to argue that sauropods, which had hitherto been depicted as sprawling aquatic animals with their tails dragging on the ground, were endotherms that lived vigorous, terrestrial lives. In 1972, Bakker expanded on his arguments based on energy requirements and predator-prey ratios. This was one of the seminal results that led to the dinosaur renaissance.<ref name=\"bakker1968\">{{cite journal |last1=Bakker |first1=R.T. |author-link=Robert T.

In 1896, Marsh calculated ratios between brain weight and body weight of seven species of dinosaurs, showing that the brain of dinosaurs was proportionally smaller than in today's crocodiles, and that the brain of ''Stegosaurus'' was smaller than in any living land vertebrate. This contributed to the widespread public notion of dinosaurs as being sluggish and extraordinarily stupid. Harry Jerison, in 1973, showed that proportionally smaller brains are expected at larger body sizes, and that brain size in dinosaurs was not smaller than expected when compared to living reptiles.<ref name=\"russell1997\"/> Later research showed that relative brain size progressively increased during the evolution of theropods, with the highest intelligence – comparable to that of modern birds – calculated for the troodontid ''Troodon''.<ref name=\"brusatte2012\"/>\n\n==Origin of birds==\n{{Main|Origin of birds}}\n\nThe possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].<ref name=huxley1868/> After the work of [[Gerhard Heilmann]] in the early 20th century, the [[Scientific theory|theory]] of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of the idea of them being descendants of generalized [[Thecodontia|thecodonts]], with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of [[clavicle]]s in dinosaurs.<ref name=heilmann/> However, as later discoveries showed, clavicles (or a single fused [[furcula|wishbone]], which derived from separate clavicles) were not actually absent;<ref name=KP04/> they had been found as early as 1924 in ''[[Oviraptor]]'', but misidentified as an [[interclavicle]].<ref name=HO24/> In the 1970s, John Ostrom revived the dinosaur–bird theory,<ref name=ostrom1973/> which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis,<ref name=gauthier1986/> and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds.<ref name=TRHJ00/> Of particular note have been the fossils of the Jehol Biota, where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found, often with feathers of some type.<ref name=\"NYT-20161208\" /><ref name=KP04/> Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives.<ref name=Mayretal2005/> They are most closely allied with maniraptoran coelurosaurs.<ref name=KP04/> A minority of scientists, most notably [[Alan Feduccia]] and [[Larry Martin]], have proposed other evolutionary paths, including revised versions of Heilmann's basal archosaur proposal,<ref name=martin2004/> or that maniraptoran theropods are the ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs, only [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with dinosaurs.<ref name=AF02/>\n\n===Feathers===\n{{Main|Feathered dinosaurs}}\n[[File:Feathered non-avian Maniraptora.jpg|thumb|Various feathered non-avian dinosaurs, including ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'', ''[[Anchiornis]]'', ''[[Microraptor]]'' and ''[[Zhenyuanlong]]'']]\nFeathers are one of the most recognizable characteristics of modern birds, and a trait that was also shared by several non-avian dinosaurs.

As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. The entry of the word \"dinosaur\" into the common [[vernacular]] reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, \"dinosaur\" is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, obsolete, or bound for extinction.<ref name=\"m-w\"/>\n\nPublic enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, a menagerie of lifelike [[Crystal Palace dinosaurs|dinosaur sculptures]] was unveiled in [[London]]'s [[Crystal Palace Park]]. The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and [[Natural history museum|museums]] around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way.<ref name=torrens1993/> The enduring popularity of dinosaurs, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the Bone Wars of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions.<ref name=breithaupt1997/>\n\nThe popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in [[literature]], [[film]], and other [[Media (communication)|media]]. Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in [[Charles Dickens]]{{'}} ''[[Bleak House]]'',<ref name=bleakhouse/> dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of [[fiction]]al works. [[Jules Verne]]'s 1864 novel ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 book ''[[The Lost World (Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', the 1914 animated film ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (featuring the first animated dinosaur), the iconic 1933 [[motion picture|film]] ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', the 1954 ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]] and its 1993 [[Jurassic Park (film)|film adaptation]] are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest [[non-fiction]] works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general.

      "reference_summary": "Dinosaurs were archosaurian reptiles that dominated the Mesozoic Era, spanning from the Late Triassic to the present day through their descendants, birds. They appeared around 233.23 million years ago and include various groups such as ornithischians, sauropodomorphs, and theropods. Notable examples include carnivorous Herrerasaurus, herbivorous Triceratops and Stegosaurus, sauropod Apatosaurus, and the bird-like dromaeosaurid Microraptor. Additionally, there are several other possible dinosaur species of uncertain affinity, such as Alwalkeria, Chilesaurus, Daemonosaurus, and Tawa. Modern birds are considered part of the theropod lineage, marking the continuation of dinosaur presence into the current era. The classification of some groups, like Silesauridae, remains debated due to potential paraphyly. Dinosaurs have been studied extensively, with significant contributions from researchers such as Matthew G. Baron, Megan E. Williams, and Andrea Cau.",
      "base_model_summary": "Dinosaurs, a group of archosaurian reptiles, dominated the Mesozoic Era from the Late Triassic to the present. They are classified into major groups such as Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, and Theropoda, which include various extinct and extant species. Notable examples include Herrerasaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Apatosaurus, Edmontosaurus, and Microraptor. Some fossils of uncertain affinity are also considered part of this group.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Dinosaurs were a diverse group of archosaurian reptiles that dominated the Mesozoic Era, spanning from the Late Triassic to the present. They are classified into three major groups: Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, and Theropoda. The Theropoda group includes various extinct groups and modern birds. Other possible dinosaurs of uncertain affinity include Agnosphytis, Alwalkeria, Chilesaurus, Chindesaurus, Daemosaurus, Eodromaeus, Nhandumirim, Nyasasaurus, Pisanosaurus, Smok, Tawa, and Thecospondylus. The classification of Silesauridae is uncertain. Dinosaurs are distinct from the similarly named dinosaur genus, which refers specifically to theropod dinosaurs. The summary captures the key points about dinosaurs' classification, their time range, and their distinction from other reptiles. It also lists some possible but uncertain dinosaur taxa.

He is considered the \"Apostle to the English\".\n\nAugustine was the [[Prior (ecclesiastical)|prior]] of a monastery in [[Rome]] when Pope [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] chose him in 595 to lead a mission, usually known as the [[Gregorian mission]], to Britain to [[Christianization|Christianize]] King [[Æthelberht of Kent|Æthelberht]] and his [[Kingdom of Kent]] from [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]]. Kent was likely chosen because Æthelberht [[Bretwalda|commanded major influence]] over [[Heptarchy|neighbouring Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] in addition to his marriage to [[Bertha of Kent|Bertha]], a [[Franks|Frankish]] princess, who was expected to exert some influence over her husband. Before reaching Kent, the missionaries had considered turning back, but Gregory urged them on, and in 597, Augustine landed on the [[Isle of Thanet]] and proceeded to Æthelberht's main town of [[Canterbury]].\n\nKing Æthelberht converted to [[Christianity]] and allowed the missionaries to preach freely, giving them land to found a monastery outside the city walls. Augustine was consecrated as a [[bishop]] and converted many of the king's subjects, including thousands during a mass baptism on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] in 597. Pope Gregory sent more missionaries in 601, along with encouraging letters and gifts for the churches, although attempts to persuade the native British bishops to submit to Augustine's authority failed. Roman bishops were established at London, and [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] in 604, and a school was founded to train [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] priests and missionaries. Augustine also arranged the [[consecration]] of his successor, [[Laurence of Canterbury]]. The archbishop probably died in 604 and was soon revered as a [[saint]].\n\n== Background to the mission ==\nAfter the withdrawal of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman legion|legions]] from their province of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] in 410, the inhabitants were left to defend themselves against the attacks of the [[Saxons]]. Before the Roman withdrawal, Britannia had been converted to Christianity and produced the [[ascetic]] [[Pelagius]].<ref name=Hindley3/><ref name=Mayr78/> Britain sent three bishops to the [[Synod of Arles (314)|Council of Arles]] in 314, and a [[Roman Gaul|Gaulish]] bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters.<ref name=Frend80>Frend \"Roman Britain\" ''Cross Goes North'' pp. 80–81</ref> Material remains testify to a growing presence of Christians, at least until around 360.<ref name=Frend82>Frend \"Roman Britain\" ''Cross Goes North'' pp. 82–86</ref> After the Roman legions departed, pagan tribes settled the southern parts of the island while western Britain, beyond the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, remained Christian. This native [[Celtic Christianity|British Church]] developed in isolation from Rome under the influence of missionaries from Ireland<ref name=Hindley3>Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 3–9</ref><ref name=Mayr78/> and was centred on monasteries instead of bishoprics. Other distinguishing characteristics were its calculation of the date of [[Easter]] and the style of the [[tonsure]] haircut that clerics wore.<ref name=Mayr78>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 78–93</ref><ref name=Yorke115>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' pp. 115–118 discusses the issue of the \"Celtic Church\" and what exactly it was.</ref> Evidence for the survival of Christianity in the eastern part of Britain during this time includes the survival of the cult of [[Saint Alban]] and the occurrence in place names of ''eccles'', derived from the Latin ''ecclesia'', meaning \"church\".<ref name=Yorke121>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 121</ref> There is no evidence that these native Christians tried to convert the Anglo-Saxons.<ref name=ASE102>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 102</ref><ref name=Harting32>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 32–33</ref> The invasions destroyed most remnants of Roman civilisation in the areas held by the Saxons and related tribes, including the economic and religious structures.<ref name=Kirby23>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 23</ref>\n\nIt was against this background that Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission, often called the Gregorian mission, to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity in 595.<ref name=ASE104>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 104–105</ref><ref name=Jones>Jones \"Gregorian Mission\" ''Speculum''</ref> The Kingdom of Kent was ruled by Æthelberht, who had married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588,<ref name=ASE105>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 105–106</ref> and perhaps earlier than 560.<ref name=Kirby24>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' pp. 24–25</ref> Bertha was the daughter of [[Charibert I]], one of the [[Merovingian]] kings of the [[Franks]].

Æthelberht was a pagan at this point but allowed his wife freedom of worship. One biographer of Bertha states that under his wife's influence, Æthelberht asked Pope Gregory to send missionaries.<ref name=DNBBertha/> The historian [[Ian N. Wood]] feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen.<ref name=Wood10>Wood \"Mission of Augustine of Canterbury\" ''Speculum'' pp. 9–10</ref> Other historians, however, believe that Gregory initiated the mission, although the exact reasons remain unclear. [[Bede]], an 8th-century monk who wrote a history of the English church, recorded a famous story in which Gregory saw fair-haired Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert their people.{{efn|Supposedly Gregory inquired about who the slaves were. He was told they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels.<ref>Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 99–100</ref>}}<ref name=Harting57>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 57–59</ref> More practical matters, such as the acquisition of new provinces acknowledging the primacy of the papacy, and a desire to influence the emerging power of the Kentish kingdom under Æthelberht, were probably involved.<ref name=Hindley33/> The mission may have been an outgrowth of the missionary efforts against the [[Lombards]] who, as pagans and [[Arian]] Christians, were not on good relations with the Catholic church in Rome.<ref name=DNB>Mayr-Harting \"Augustine\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>\n\nAside from Æthelberht's granting of freedom of worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated by a number of other factors. Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King [[Ceawlin of Wessex]] in 592, Æthelberht was the ''[[bretwalda]]'', or leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having [[imperium]] (overlordship) south of the [[Humber|River Humber]]. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established, and the [[language barrier]] between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area.<ref name=Brooks7>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 6–7</ref> There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Bertha's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence was not merely political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.<ref name=Kirby27>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 27</ref>\n\nIn 595, Gregory chose Augustine, who was the prior of the [[San Gregorio Magno al Celio|Abbey of St Andrew]] in Rome, to head the mission to Kent.<ref name=ASE104/> The pope selected monks to accompany Augustine and sought support from the Frankish royalty and clergy in a series of letters, of which some copies survive in Rome. He wrote to King [[Theuderic II]] of [[Burgundy]] and to King [[Theudebert II]] of [[Austrasia]], as well as their grandmother [[Brunhilda of Austrasia|Brunhild]], seeking aid for the mission. Gregory thanked King [[Chlothar II]] of [[Neustria]] for aiding Augustine. Besides hospitality, the Frankish bishops and kings provided interpreters and Frankish priests to accompany the mission.<ref name=Brooks4>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 4–5</ref> By soliciting help from the Frankish kings and bishops, Gregory helped to assure a friendly reception for Augustine in Kent, as Æthelbert was unlikely to mistreat a mission which visibly had the support of his wife's relatives and people.<ref name=Brooks6>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 6</ref> Moreover, the Franks appreciated the chance to participate in mission that would extend their influence in Kent. Chlothar, in particular, needed a friendly realm across the Channel to help guard his kingdom's flanks against his fellow Frankish kings.<ref name=Wood9>Wood \"Mission of Augustine of Canterbury\" ''Speculum'' p. 9</ref>\n\nSources make no mention of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to Æthelberht complimenting Augustine's knowledge of the [[Bible]], so Augustine was evidently well educated. Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews as well as being pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.<ref name=Fletcher116>Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' pp. 116–117</ref>\n\n== Arrival and first efforts ==\n[[File:Britain peoples circa 600.svg|330px|left|thumb|Map of the general outlines of some of the British kingdoms in about 600|alt=Map showing the kingdoms of Dyfed, Powys, and Gwynedd in the west central part of the island of Great Britain.

The northern kingdoms are Elmet, Deira, and Bernicia.]]\n\nAugustine was accompanied by [[Laurence of Canterbury]], his eventual successor to the [[archbishop]]ric, and a group of about 40 companions, some of whom were monks.<ref name=ASE105/> Soon after leaving Rome, the missionaries halted, daunted by the nature of the task before them. They sent Augustine back to Rome to request papal permission to return. Gregory refused and sent Augustine back with letters encouraging the missionaries to persevere.<ref name=Blair116>Blair ''Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 116–117</ref> In 597, Augustine and his companions landed in Kent.<ref name=ASE105/> They achieved some initial success soon after their arrival:<ref name=DNB/><ref name=\"Fletcher116\" /> Æthelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury where they used the church of St Martin's for services.<ref name=Brooks8/> Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of Æthelberht's conversion,<ref name=Woods11>Wood \"Mission of Augustine of Canterbury\" ''Speculum'' p. 11</ref> but it probably took place in 597.<ref name=Brooks8/>{{efn|However, Bede's chronology may be a bit off, as he gives the king's death as occurring in February 616, and says the king died 21 years after his conversion, which would date the conversion to 595. This would be before Augustine's mission, and directly contradicts Bede's statement that the king's conversion was due to Augustine's mission.<ref name=\"Kirby24\" /> However, as Gregory in his letter of 601 to the king and queen strongly implies that the queen was unable to effect the conversion of her husband, the problem of the dating is likely a chronological error on Bede's part.<ref name=Kirby28/>}} In the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period, large-scale conversions required the ruler's conversion first, and Augustine is recorded as making large numbers of converts within a year of his arrival in Kent.<ref name=Brooks8/> Also, by 601, Gregory was writing to both Æthelberht and Bertha, calling the king his son and referring to his baptism.{{efn|The letter, as translated in Brooks' ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'', p. 8, says \"preserve the grace he had received\". ''Grace'' in this context meant the grace of baptism.}} A [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] tradition, recorded by the 15th-century chronicler [[Thomas Elmham]], gives the date of the king's conversion as [[Pentecost|Whit Sunday]], or 2 June 597; there is no reason to doubt this date, although there is no other evidence for it.<ref name=Brooks8>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 8–9</ref> Against a date in 597 is a letter of Gregory's to Patriarch [[Eulogius of Alexandria]] in June 598, which mentions the number of converts made by Augustine, but does not mention any baptism of the king. However, it is clear that by 601 the king had been converted.<ref name=Kirby28>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 28</ref> His baptism likely took place at Canterbury.<ref name=Convert56>Higham ''Convert Kings'' p. 56</ref>\n\nAugustine established his [[episcopal see]] at Canterbury.<ref name=DNB/> It is not clear when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop [[Ætherius]] of [[Arles]], Gaul (France) after the conversion of Æthelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop, and one dated ten months later says Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the German lands.<ref name=Brooks5>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 5</ref> The historian R. A. Markus discusses the various theories of when and where Augustine was consecrated, and suggests he was consecrated before arriving in England, but argues the evidence does not permit deciding exactly where this took place.<ref name=Markus24>Markus \"Chronology of the Gregorian Mission\" ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' pp. 24–29</ref>\n\nSoon after his arrival, Augustine founded the [[monastery]] of Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], which later became [[St Augustine's Abbey]],<ref name=DNB/> on land donated by the king.<ref name=Blair61>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' pp. 61–62</ref> In a letter Gregory wrote to the [[patriarch of Alexandria]] in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is no reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place.<ref name=ASE105/><ref name=Fletcher116/> However, there were probably some Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire.<ref name=\"Harting32\" /> Little literary traces remain of them, however.<ref name=Frend79>Frend \"Roman Britain\" ''Cross Goes North'' p. 79</ref> One other effect of the king's conversion by Augustine's mission was that the Frankish influence on the southern kingdoms of Britain was decreased.<ref name=Kirby29>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 29</ref>\n\nAfter these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with a report of his success, along with questions about the mission.<ref name=ASE106>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 106</ref> Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]''; this section of the ''History'' is usually known as the ''[[Libellus responsionum]]''.<ref name=Laurentius>Lapidge \"Laurentius\" ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref><ref name=Bede71/> Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.<ref name=Bede71>Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 71–83</ref>\n\nFurther missionaries were sent from Rome in 601. They brought a [[pallium]] for Augustine and a present of sacred vessels, [[vestment]]s, [[relic]]s, and books.{{efn|What happened to these items in later years is unknown. [[Thomas Elmham]], a 15th-century chronicler at Canterbury, gave a number of theories of how most of these objects were lost, including being hidden and never recovered during the [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Danish attacks]] in the 9th and 10th centuries, hidden and lost after the [[Norman Conquest]] of England in 1066, or used for the ransom of King [[Richard I of England]] in the 1190s.<ref name=Dodwell10>Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' p. 10</ref> The surviving [[St Augustine Gospels]], ([[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] manuscript (MS) 286) which is a 6th-century Italian-illuminated [[Gospel Book]], may be one of the works sent to Augustine. Traditionally, it has been associated with the [[Gregorian mission]].<ref name=Dodwell96>Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' pp. 96 and 276 footnote 66</ref> Another possible survival is a Gospel, in an Italian hand, and closely related to the Augustine Gospels, now MS Oxford Bodelian Auctarium D.2.14, which shows evidence of being held in Anglo-Saxon hands during the right time frame. Lastly, a fragment of a work by Gregory the Great, now held by the [[British Library]] as part of MS [[Cotton library|Cotton]] Titus C may have arrived with the missionaries.<ref name=Library24>Lapidge ''Anglo-Saxon Library'' pp. 24–25</ref>}} The pallium was the symbol of [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] status, and signified that Augustine was now an archbishop unambiguously associated with the Holy See. Along with the pallium, a letter from Gregory directed the new archbishop to consecrate 12 [[suffragan bishop]]s as soon as possible and to send a bishop to [[York]]. Gregory's plan was that there would be two metropolitans, one at York and one at London, with 12 suffragan bishops under each archbishop. As part of this plan, Augustine was expected to transfer his archiepiscopal see to London from Canterbury. This move never happened; no contemporary sources give the reason,<ref name=Brooks9>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 9–11</ref> but it was probably because London was not part of Æthelberht's domains. Instead, London was part of the [[kingdom of Essex]], ruled by Æthelberht's nephew [[Saebert of Essex]], who converted to Christianity in 604.<ref name=Hindley33/><ref name=Fletcher453>Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' p. 453</ref> The historian S. Brechter has suggested that the metropolitan see was indeed moved to London, and that it was only with the abandonment of London as a see after the death of Æthelberht that Canterbury became the archiepiscopal see. This theory contradicts Bede's version of events, however.<ref name=Brooks11>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 11–14</ref>\n\n== Additional work ==\n[[File:Aethelberht of Kent sculpture on Canterbury Cathedral.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Æthelberht of Kent]] imagined in a statue at [[Canterbury Cathedral]]|alt=Stone statue of a crowned man holding a sceptre.]]\n\nIn 604, Augustine founded two more bishoprics in Britain.

Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him,<ref name=Harting70>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 70–72</ref> apparently believing that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organisation survived in Britain than was actually the case.<ref name=Conversion118>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 118</ref> According to the narrative of Bede, the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine with uncertainty, and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine's part.<ref name=ASE110>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 110–111</ref> In 603, Augustine and Æthelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting south of the Severn. These guests retired early to confer with their people,<ref name=Hindley8/> who, according to Bede, advised them to judge Augustine based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting. When Augustine failed to rise from his seat on the entrance of the British bishops,<ref name=Bede100>Bede ''History of the English Church and People'' pp. 100–103</ref> they refused to recognise him as their archbishop.<ref name=Hindley8>Hindley ''Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 8–9</ref><ref name=Harting72/> There were, however, deep differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement. At issue were the tonsure, the observance of Easter, and practical and deep-rooted differences in approach to asceticism, missionary endeavours, and how the church itself was organised.<ref name=ASE110/> Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church, damaging his relations with their bishops.<ref name=Harting72>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 72–73</ref> Also, there were political dimensions involved, as Augustine's efforts were sponsored by the Kentish king, and at this period the Wessex and Mercian kingdoms were expanding to the west, into areas held by the Britons.<ref name=Conversion119>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 119</ref>\n\n== Further success ==\nGregory also instructed Augustine on other matters. Temples were to be consecrated for Christian use,<ref name=Thomson8>Thomson ''Western Church'' p. 8</ref> and feasts, if possible, moved to days celebrating Christian martyrs. One religious site was revealed to be a shrine of a local St Sixtus, whose worshippers were unaware of details of the martyr's life or death. They may have been native Christians, but Augustine did not treat them as such. When Gregory was informed, he told Augustine to stop the cult and use the shrine for the Roman [[Pope Sixtus II|St Sixtus]].<ref name=Blair24>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 24</ref>\n\nGregory legislated on the behaviour of the laity and the clergy. He placed the new mission directly under papal authority and made it clear that English bishops would have no authority over Frankish counterparts nor vice versa. Other directives dealt with the training of native clergy and the missionaries' conduct.<ref name=ASE107>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 107–108</ref>\n\n[[The King's School, Canterbury]] claims Augustine as its founder, which would make it the world's oldest existing school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kings-school.co.uk/document_1.aspx?id=1:31887&id=1:31658&id=1:31637 |title=597 and all that: A Brief History of the King's School, Canterbury |access-date=31 March 2008 |publisher=The King's School, Canterbury |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928010901/http://www.kings-school.co.uk/document_1.aspx?id=1%3A31887&id=1%3A31658&id=1%3A31637 |archive-date=28 September 2011 }}</ref> Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the [[East Anglia]]n mission.<ref name=Brooks94>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' pp. 94–95</ref> Augustine received [[liturgical book]]s from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown.

Despite the earlier presence of Christians in Ireland and Wales, no efforts had been made to try to convert the Saxon invaders. Augustine was sent to convert the descendants of those invaders, and eventually became the decisive influence in Christianity in most of the British Isles.<ref name=ASE110/><ref name=Collins185>Collins ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 185</ref> Much of his success came about because of Augustine's close relationship with Æthelberht, which gave the archbishop time to establish himself.<ref name=Harting249>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 249</ref> Augustine's example also influenced the great missionary efforts of the Anglo-Saxon Church.<ref name=Harting264>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 265–266</ref><ref name=Wood8>Wood \"Mission of Augustine of Canterbury\" ''Speculum'' p. 8</ref>\n\nAugustine's body was originally buried in the portico of what is now St Augustine's, Canterbury,<ref name=\"Blair61\" /> but it was later exhumed and placed in a tomb within the abbey church, which became a place of pilgrimage and veneration. After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] the cult of St Augustine was actively promoted.<ref name=DNB/> After the Conquest, his [[shrine]] in St Augustine's Abbey held a central position in one of the axial chapels, flanked by the shrines of his successors Laurence and Mellitus.<ref name=Nilson67>Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 67</ref> King [[Henry I of England]] granted St. Augustine's Abbey a six-day [[fair]] around the date on which Augustine's relics were [[Translation (relics)|translated]] to his new shrine, from 8 September through 13 September.<ref name=Shrines>Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 93</ref>\n\nA life of Augustine was written by [[Goscelin]] around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a different light, compared to Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches.<ref name=Gameson17>Gameson and Gameson \"From Augustine to Parker\" ''Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 17–20</ref> Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful.<ref name=Gameson19>Gameson and Gameson \"From Augustine to Parker\" ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 19</ref> These authors included [[William of Malmesbury]], who claimed that Augustine founded [[Cerne Abbey]],<ref name=Gameson20>Gameson and Gameson \"From Augustine to Parker\" ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 20</ref> the author (generally believed to be [[John Brompton]]) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine,<ref name=Gameson24>Gameson and Gameson \"From Augustine to Parker\" ''Anglo-Saxons'' p. 24</ref> and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]].<ref name=Gameson22>Gameson and Gameson \"From Augustine to Parker\" ''Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 22–31</ref> Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and [[Augustine of Hippo]], a fourth-century saint.

She contributed drawings and paintings to more than 200 books, mostly in the children's genre. She was the first illustrator of some of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s minor works, including ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''. She became well-known for her cover illustrations for ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and for her poster map with inset illustrations, ''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]''. She illustrated all seven volumes of [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]'', from the first book, ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''. Gaining a reputation as the \"Narnia artist\", she illustratred spinoffs like [[Brian Sibley]]'s ''The Land of Narnia''. In addition to work for other authors, including illustrating [[Roger Lancelyn Green]]'s ''The Tales of Troy'' and [[Iona Opie|Iona]] and [[Peter Opie]]'s books of nursery rhymes, Baynes created some 600 illustrations for Grant Uden's ''A Dictionary of Chivalry'', for which she won the [[Kate Greenaway Medal]].

The film, a fictionalized account based on historical events, stars [[Thure Lindhardt]] and [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as two [[Danish resistance movement]] fighters nicknamed [[Bent Faurschou Hviid|Flammen]] and [[Jørgen Haagen Schmith|Citronen]], during the [[occupation of Denmark|Nazi occupation of Denmark]] in [[World War II]]. Attracted by the story of the pair since he was twelve, Madsen spent eight years along with co-writer Lars K. Andersen researching historical archives to produce it.\n\nMadsen's idea was to bring attention to the story of Flammen and Citronen as he felt it had been neglected or misrepresented. The most expensive Danish film produced to that date, it was co-produced by German companies because initially there was no interest in producing the film in Denmark. Portraying the protagonists as morally ambiguous characters, the director tried to depict war as a complicated experience that goes beyond a [[Good and evil|good versus evil dichotomy]]. With visual and narrative references borrowed from ''[[film noir]]'' and the French film ''[[Army of Shadows]]'', ''Flame & Citron'' also explores themes of love, betrayal, and the emotional aspects of relationships.\n\nThe film was released in Denmark on 28&nbsp;March 2008 to positive reviews. The most-watched film in the country that year, it was praised mostly for the actors' performances, dramatic style, and depiction of war and its moral dilemmas. Considered an [[art film]] by some critics, the film was compared, both favorably and negatively, to ''Army of Shadows'' and other war films; it also sparked a debate over its historical accuracy. Additionally, it was nominated for both domestic and international film awards, including the [[Robert Awards]], the [[Bodil Awards]], and the [[European Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nSet after the [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|Nazi invasion of Denmark]], the film focuses on the [[Holger Danske (resistance group)|Holger Danske]] resistance group's [[Bent Faurschou Hviid]] (known as Flammen) and [[Jørgen Haagen Schmith]] (known as Citronen). In a bar, Bent flirts with a woman, who identifies herself as Ketty Selmer and disturbs him by saying his real name. Bent follows and confronts her, whereupon she says she is a courier running messages between Stockholm and Copenhagen.\n\nAksel Winther, Bent and Jørgen's handler, asks them to kill Elisabeth Lorentzen, Horst Gilbert, and Hermann Seibold–members of the [[Abwehr]], German military intelligence. Bent and Jørgen argue over it as they kill only Danes, to reduce the chance of Nazi retaliation. Winther claims to be acting on orders from the government in exile. Bent kills Lorentzen but fails to kill Gilbert and Seibold. Jørgen, his wife, Bodil and their daughter, Ann, celebrate Ann's birthday in their car as they lack money, and Bodil laments over their relationship. Later, Bent, Jørgen and Whinter meet Spex from the [[Danish Defence Intelligence Service|Danish Army Intelligence]]. He says there will be no more attacks, as they need peace for a big attack. They agree not to follow Spex's order and Jørgen kills Gilbert. That night, Jørgen robs a grocery store and takes the products to his family; however, Bodil announces she is seeing another man.\n\nAfter several members of the resistance are killed by the [[Gestapo]], Winther suspects they have an informant. Later, Bent visits Ketty's hotel and they have sex. Jørgen visits his wife and advises her boyfriend to treat her properly or he will return. In a meeting, Winther says the informer is Ketty and orders her death. Bent meets Ketty; she tells him she works for Winther and for army intelligence and that Winther does not work for the British. Winther, involved with Gilbert and Seibold, had ordered their death to not to be seen as a traitor. Bent and Jørgen search for Winther in a bar and discover that he has escaped to Stockholm. They realize it is a trap, and escape from the Gestapo. They decide to kill Karl Heinz Hoffmann, the Gestapo leader and then take over the Gestapo's favorite restaurant. Bent abandons his plan when he sees approaching police. That night, Ketty says to Bent that he and Jørgen should go to Stockholm. In the meeting, they are offered positions in the Danish Army but refuse. A man called Ravnen gives them the name of the real informer and Jørgen kills him.\n\nBent visits his father, a hotel owner, who says Hoffmann, his family and his mistresses visit there on occasion. Bent sees Ketty arrive at the hotel with Hoffman in what appears to be a tryst. Later, Bent confronts Ketty and she says army intelligence requested her to stay close to Hoffmann. Bent asks what car Hoffman uses and what his route is. Later, on the road, Bent, Jørgen and others open fire on two cars with Nazi flags but are dismayed to discover they have killed a father and wounded a child. An enraged Bent goes to Ketty's hotel room, only to discover that she has flown to Stockholm, fearing Hoffmann's retaliation. Bent and Jørgen again plan to kill Hoffmann and disguise themselves as policemen. They are arrested in a general round-up of and execution of [[deportation of the Danish police|the German-allied Danish police]]. Jørgen leaps a fence and is shot, allowing Bent to escape. Jørgen flees to a safe house but, when a German squad arrives, he kills some with a sub-machine gun and grenades but is killed. Bent, in his home, commits suicide with a [[cyanide pill]] when the Gestapo arrives.

Birkelund pointed out that he had already moved to Sweden by the time of their assassinations, while Madsen stated he was sure Leifer gave orders before leaving the country. Also, they met Frode Jacobsen in a meeting in Sweden, and he is said to have given orders from there. Birkelund rejected the idea of Jacobsen giving orders, but Madsen said the meetings were created by him to show that the resistance movements of that time had approaches different from those of their present-day counterparts.<ref name=avisen/>\n\nCitron's relationship with his wife was debated because historians doubt that she betrayed him, since she gave birth to their child shortly after his death.<ref name=avisen/> Madsen was sure the betrayal happened, but he took the liberty of affirming the couple did not get back together.<ref name=avisen/> Madsen declared, \"I do not think it is morally tarnished to show that people have affairs with people they are not married to. It's a beautiful description of a relationship that falls apart in a time that had great personal cost.\"<ref name=avisen/>\n\nOle Ewé, a former member of [[BOPA]]—another group in the Danish resistance movement—disagreed with the description of the attempt to kill the Gestapo leader Hoffman on the [[Roskildevej]] road. In the film, the car had Nazi flags, and a soldier and his son are killed by resistance gunfire. Ewé said that on that day he and other BOPA members were enlisted to kill {{ill|Arno Oskar Hammeken|da}}, a Gestapo informer. Flammen, who also received tips about the informer's whereabouts, appeared there and shot up the car. Ewé said that the man in the car was in civilian clothes and there were no Nazi flags on the car.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://arbejderen.dk/artikel/2008-04-02/jeg-s-flammen-skyde |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915043351/http://arbejderen.dk/artikel/2008-04-02/jeg-s-flammen-skyde |archive-date=15 September 2016 |title=- Jeg så Flammen skyde |author=Fenger, Anders |date=2 April 2008 |work={{ill|Dagbladet Arbejderen|da}} |access-date=5 May 2015 |language=Danish |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=I think we're incredibly puritanical about our own history in this country.

Flame & Citron was the most expensive Danish film produced to date and was co-produced by German companies due to initial lack of interest in Denmark. The film also incorporates visual and narrative references from film noir and other war films. Flame & Citron was released in Denmark on March 28, 2008, and became the most-watched film that year. It explores themes of love, betrayal, and moral dilemmas, portraying war as a complicated experience beyond a simple good versus evil dichotomy. The film was distributed by Sandrew Metronome and had a runtime of 130 minutes. It was produced by Nimbus Film, Wüste Film, and Babelsberg Studio. The budget was $8.6 million, and it grossed $10 million. Flame & Citron was considered an art film by some critics and sparked discussions about its historical accuracy. The film was also nominated for domestic and international film awards, including the Robert Awards, the Bodil Awards, and the European Film Awards. The plot revolves around the resistance fighters' efforts to disrupt Nazi operations while dealing with their personal struggles. The film ends with the characters realizing that there will be no more attacks from the resistance group. Flame & Citron highlights the emotional and moral complexities of war through its compelling storytelling and strong performances. It serves as a tribute to the courage and resilience of those who resisted Nazi oppression during World War II. The film also sparked conversations about the portrayal of historical events in cinema and the importance of remembering and honoring the sacrifices made by resistance fighters. Flame & Citron is both a historical drama and an art film that invites viewers to reflect on the human experiences of war and resistance. It remains a significant contribution to Danish cinema and a valuable reminder of the past. Flame & Citron",

It was released on January 9, 2015, by [[Epic Records]]. Initially a songwriter for other artists, in 2013, Trainor signed with the label the following year and began recording material she co-wrote with [[Kevin Kadish]]. They were dissatisfied with the [[electronic dance music]] predominant in [[contemporary hit radio]] and drew influence from [[Retro style|retro-styled]] [[1950s in music|1950s]] and [[1960s in music|1960s music]].\n\n''Title'' is a [[doo-wop]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[blue-eyed soul]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] record, with elements of [[List of Caribbean music genres|Caribbean]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[reggae]], and [[soca music]]. Inspired by past relationships and her insecurities about [[body image]], Trainor wrote songs she wished existed before she attended high school. The songs on the album explore themes such as [[Women's empowerment|female empowerment]], [[Self-esteem|self-respect]], and [[self-awareness]]. Trainor promoted the \"album\" with several public appearances and televised performances.\n\nAfter ''Title''{{'s}} release, Trainor embarked on the 2015 concert tours [[That Bass Tour]] and [[MTrain Tour]]. The album was supported by four [[Single (music)|singles]], including \"[[All About That Bass]]\" which reached number one in 58countries and became the best-selling song by a female artist during the [[2010s in music|2010s]] in the US. It also produced the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top-15 singles \"[[Lips Are Movin]]\", \"[[Dear Future Husband]]\", and \"[[Like I'm Gonna Lose You]]\", the last of which features [[John Legend]] and peaked at number one in Australia, New Zealand, and Poland. Reviewers criticized ''Title''{{'}}s repetitiveness and did not foresee a long-lasting career for Trainor, though some appreciated her wit and audacious attitude.\n\n''Title'' debuted at number one on charts in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, and spent multiple weeks at the summit in Australia and New Zealand. It was Epic's first number-one album in the US since 2010, and in Australia since [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[The Essential Michael Jackson]]'' in 2005. ''Title'' made Trainor the fifth female artist in history to send her debut single and album to number one and follow-up single to the top five in the US. It was the ninth-best-selling album of 2015 worldwide, and earned [[List of music recording certifications|multi-platinum certifications]] in the United States, Australia, Canada, and Poland.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Meghan Trainor]] developed an early interest in music and started singing at age six.<ref name=\"Cape Cod Times\">{{cite news|author=Sullivan, Jim|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20140830/ENTERTAIN/140829518|title=Meghan Trainor hits big time with 'All About That Bass'|work=[[Cape Cod Times]]|date=August 30, 2014|access-date=June 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529082618/http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20140830/ENTERTAIN/140829518|archive-date=May 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> She began performing her compositions and [[soca music]] as part of the [[cover band]] Island Fusion, which included her aunt, younger brother, and father.<ref name=\"Boston Globe\" /><ref name=\"Entertainment Weekly\">{{cite magazine|author=Markovitz, Adam|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/10/meghan-trainor-all-about-that-bass-beyonce-swift-bieber|title=Meghan Trainor talks 'All About That Bass,' Beyonce, and Bieber|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=October 10, 2014|access-date=June 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610050338/http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/10/meghan-trainor-all-about-that-bass-beyonce-swift-bieber|archive-date=June 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Trainor temporarily relocated to [[Orleans, Massachusetts]], with her family when she was in eighth grade, before moving to [[North Eastham, Massachusetts]].

It is an ambitious work in scope and in its variety of style and scoring, and has a duration of around 90 minutes. Published in Venice (with a dedication to [[Pope Paul V]] dated 1 September 1610) as {{Lang|la|Sanctissimae Virgini Missa senis vocibus ac Vesperae pluribus decantandae, cum nonnullis sacris concentibus, ad Sacella sive Principum Cubicula accommodata}} (\"Mass for the Most Holy Virgin for six voices, and Vespers for several voices with some sacred songs, suitable for chapels and ducal chambers\"), it is sometimes called Monteverdi's '''''Vespers of 1610'''''.\n\nMonteverdi composed the music while musician and composer for the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]]s, the [[dukes of Mantua]]. The libretto is compiled from several [[Latin]] [[Bible|Biblical]] and [[liturgy|liturgical]] texts. The thirteen [[Movement (music)|movements]] include the introductory ''[[Deus in adiutorium]]'', five Psalms, four ''[[concertato]]'' [[motet]]s and a vocal [[sonata]] on the \"[[Litany of Loreto|Sancta Maria]]\" litany, several differently scored [[stanza]]s of the hymn \"[[Ave maris stella]]\", and a choice of two [[Magnificat]]s. A church performance would have included [[antiphons]] in [[Gregorian chant]] for the specific feast day. The composition demonstrates Monteverdi's ability to assimilate both the new ''[[seconda pratica]]'', such as in the [[Origins of opera|emerging opera]], and the old style of the ''[[prima pratica]]'', building psalms and Magnificat on the traditional plainchant as a [[cantus firmus]]. The composition is scored for up to ten vocal parts and instruments including [[cornett]]os, violins, [[Viola da braccio (instrument)|viole da braccio]], and [[basso continuo]]. Monteverdi travelled to Rome to deliver the composition to the Pope in person, and a [[partbook]] is held by the [[Vatican Library]].\n\nNo performance during the composer's lifetime can be positively identified from surviving documents,{{efn|[[Constantijn Huygens]] heard a Vespers by Monteverdi, but on [[Midsummer Day|St. John's Day]].{{sfn|Noske|1985|pp=118–122}}}} though parts of the work might have been performed at the ducal chapels in Mantua and at [[St Mark's Basilica|San Marco in Venice]], where the composer became director of music in 1613. The work received renewed attention from [[musicologist]]s and performers in the 20th century. They have discussed whether it is a planned composition in a modern sense or a collection of music suitable for Vespers, and have debated the role of the added movements, instrumentation, keys and other issues of [[historically informed performance]]. The first recording of excerpts from the Vespers was released in 1953; many recordings that followed presented all the music printed in 1610. In some recordings and performances, antiphons for a given occasion of the [[church year]] are added to create a liturgical vespers service, while others strictly present only the printed music. Monteverdi's Vespers are regarded as a unique milestone of music history, at the [[Transition from Renaissance to Baroque in instrumental music|transition from Renaissance to Baroque]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History and context ==\n=== Monteverdi in Mantua ===\n[[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]], who was born in [[Cremona]] in 1567, was a court musician for the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga dukes]] of [[Mantua]] from 1590 to 1612. He began as a [[viol]] player under [[Vincent I, Duke of Mantua and Montferrat|Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga]]{{sfn|Carter|2007}} and advanced to become ''[[Maestro di cappella|maestro della musica]]'' in late 1601.{{sfn|Bowers|2010|p=41}} He was responsible for the duke's sacred and secular music, in regular church services and soirées on Fridays, and for extraordinary events.{{sfn|Bowers|2010|pp=41–42}} While Monteverdi was court musician in Mantua, [[Origins of opera|the opera genre emerged]], first as entertainment for nobility, to become public musical theatre later.{{sfn|Carter|2002|pp=1–3}} The first work now considered as an opera is Jacopo Peri's ''[[Dafne]]'' of 1597. In the new genre, a complete story was told through characters; as well as choruses and [[Musical ensemble#Musical drama|ensembles]], the vocal parts included [[recitative]], [[aria]], and [[arioso]].{{sfn|Ringer|2006|pp=23–24}} Monteverdi's first opera was ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' which premiered in 1607. The duke was quick to recognise the potential of this new musical form for bringing prestige to those willing to sponsor it.{{sfn|Ringer|2006|p=16}}\n\nMonteverdi wrote the movements of the Vespers piece by piece, while responsible for the ducal services which were held at the Santa Croce chapel at the [[Ducal palace, Mantua|palace]].{{sfn|Bowers|2010|p=42}} He completed the large-scale work in 1610.

At Monteverdi's time, it was sung in [[Latin]], as were all Catholic services then.

In his Vespers, Monteverdi may have offered such music without necessarily expecting that all of it would be performed in a given service.{{sfn|Whenham|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MV94EVZwR3sC&pg=PA10 10]}}\n\nMonteverdi deviated from the typical vespers liturgy by adding [[motet]]s (''concerti'' or ''sacri concentus'') between the psalms. Scholars debate if they were meant to replace antiphons{{sfn|Whenham|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MV94EVZwR3sC&pg=PA16 16–17]}} or rather as embellishments of the preceding psalm.{{sfn|Whenham|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MV94EVZwR3sC&pg=PA21 21]}} Monteverdi also included a [[Marian litany]], \"Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis\" (Holy Mary, pray for us).{{sfn|Wolf|2013|p=ii}} All liturgical texts are set using their [[Reciting tone|psalm tones]] in Gregorian chant, often as a [[cantus firmus]].{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA3 3]}}\n\nGraham Dixon suggests the setting is more suited for the feast of [[Saint Barbara]], claiming, for example, that the texts from the [[Song of Songs]] are applicable to any female saint but that a dedication to fit a Marian feast made the work more \"marketable\".{{sfn|Knighton|1990}} There are just two Marian songs in the whole work (\"Audi coelum\" and \"Ave maris stella\"); and the sonata could easily be rearranged to any saint's name.{{sfn|Whenham|1997|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MV94EVZwR3sC&pg=PA33 33–34]}}<!--; and the text of the ''Duo Seraphim'' is connected with Saint Barbara (because she is generally connected with Trinity).- may return when source is found-->\n\n=== First publication ===\n[[File:SanctissimaeVirgini.png|thumb|upright|Title page of the partbook for Cantus ([[soprano]])]]\n\nThe first mention of the work's publication is in a July 1610 letter by Monteverdi's assistant, Bassano Casola, to [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua|Ferdinando Gonzaga]], the duke's younger son. Casola described that two compositions were in the process to be printed, a six-part [[Mass (music)|mass]] (''Messa da Capella''){{sfn|Wolf|2013|p=xii}} on [[Motif (music)|motif]]s from [[Nicolas Gombert]]'s ''In illo tempore'', and psalms for a vespers setting for the Virgin (''Salmi del Vespro della Madonna'').{{sfn|Wolf|2013|p=xii}} He described the psalms as \"varying and diverse inventions and harmonies over a canto fermo\" (cantus firmus),{{sfn|Wolf|2013|p=xii}} and noted that Monteverdi would travel to Rome to personally dedicate the publication to the Pope in the autumn.{{sfn|Wolf|2013|p=xii}}\n\nThe printing was completed in [[Venice]], then an important centre for music printing.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2012}} The printing of collections of sacred music in Italy at the period has been described as \"a fast-growing and very large and lucrative market\",{{sfn|Kurtzman|2012}} with around 50 collections in 1610 alone, 36 of them for [[Liturgy of the Hours|offices]] such as Vespers.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2012}} The publisher was [[Ricciardo Amadino]],{{sfn|Wolf|2013|p=xii}} who had published Monteverdi's opera ''L'Orfeo'' in 1609. While the opera was published as a [[Sheet music|score]], the Vespers music appeared as a set of [[partbook]]s.{{sfn|McCreesh|1995|p=325}} It was published together with Monteverdi's mass ''Missa in illo tempore''.{{sfn|Wolf|2013|p=xii}} The cover describes both works: \"Sanctissimae Virgini Missa senis vocibus ad ecclesiarum choros, ac Vespere pluribus decantandae cum nonnullis sacris concentibus ad Sacella sive Principum Cubicula accommodata\" (Mass for the Most Holy Virgin for six voices for church choirs, and vespers for several voices with some sacred songs, suitable for chapels and ducal chambers).{{sfn|Wolf|2013|p=xii}}\n\n[[File:Monteverdi Marienvesper Altus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|alt= Two pages of printed music from the alto short score, with the voice part left and the corresponding basso continuo right, with names of other instruments|From the Magnificat, a page from the [[alto]] partbook ([[short score]]), the voice part left and continuo part right]]\nOne of the partbooks contains the [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]] and provides a kind of [[short score]] for the more complicated movements:{{sfn|McCreesh|1995|p=325}} it gives the title of the Vespers as: \"Vespro della Beata Vergine da concerto composta sopra canti firmi\" (Vesper for the Blessed Virgin for concertos, composed on cantus firmi).{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA1 1]}}\n\nMonteverdi's notation is still in the style of [[Renaissance music]], for example regarding the duration of notes and the absence of [[bar line]]s. There is no score, but a partbook for each voice and instrument. The corresponding continuo notes the beginnings of text lines, for example Magnificat, \"Et exultauit\", \"Quia respexit\" and \"Quia fecit\", and the names of instruments, for example [[cornett]]o, trombone and [[Flauto traverso|flauto]]. The [[initial]]s of a title are embellished, such as the M of Magnificat, and in the voice part, the initials of a cantus firmus line begin with a larger letter, e.g. \"E <small>t exultauit{{nbsp}}...</small>\" and \"Q <small>uia respexit{{nbsp}}...</small>\". Sections where the voice or instrument is silent are marked \"Tacet.\". The notation poses challenges to editors adopting the current system of notation, which was established about a half-century after Vespers was written.{{sfn|Bowers|1992|p=347}}\n\nMonteverdi dedicated the work to [[Pope Paul V]], who had recently visited Mantua,{{sfn|Butt|2017|p=8}} and dated the dedication 1 September 1610.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA41 41]}} The schedule seems to have resulted in some of the movements being printed in haste{{sfn|Wolf|2013|pp=xii, xxvii}} and some corrections had to be made. Monteverdi visited Rome, as anticipated, in October 1610 and it is likely that he delivered a copy to the Pope, given that the [[Vatican Library|Papal Library]] holds an alto partbook.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA42 42–43]}} It is not clear whether he was honoured with a [[papal audience]].{{sfn|Bowers|2010|p=41}}{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA42 42]}} The alto partbook which the Pope received, with hand-written corrections, survived in the Biblioteca Doria Pamphilij.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2012}}\n\nMonteverdi later wrote further music for vespers services, in the collection ''[[Selva morale e spirituale]]'', published in 1641, and in another collection, ''Messa e Salmi'' (Mass and Psalms) which was published after his death in 1650. There is no indication that any of his publications of sacred music received a second edition.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2012}}\n\n=== Later publication ===\nAfter the original print, the next time parts from the Vespers were published was in an 1834 book by [[Carl von Winterfeld]] devoted to the music of [[Giovanni Gabrieli]]. He chose the beginning of the Dixit Dominus and of the Deposuit from the Magnificat, discussing the variety of styles in detail. [[Luigi Torchi (musician)|Luigi Torchi]] published the Sonata as the first complete movement from the Vespers at the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA15 15]}} The first modern edition of the Vespers appeared in 1932 as part of [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]]'s edition of Monteverdi's complete works.

Monteverdi devotes a movement to every verse of the canticle, and two to the doxology. Depending on the mood of the text, the Magnificat is scored for a choir of up to seven voices, in solo, duo, or trio singing.{{sfn|Wolf|2013|p=114}} Monteverdi uses the Magnificat tone in every movement, a tone similar to the psalm tones but with an ''initium'' (beginning) which provides the possibility of more harmonic variety.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA4 4]}}\n\nThe publication contains a second setting of the Magnificat for six voices and continuo accompaniment.{{sfn|McCreesh|1995|p=325}}\n\n[[File:Viola da braccio.jpg|thumb|alt=Fresco of a man holding a yellowish string instrument to his neck and bowing|Viola da braccio on a fresco by [[Gaudenzio Ferrari]] in Santa Maria dei Miracoli, c. 1535]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ Movements of the Magnificat\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | No.\n! scope=\"col\" | Text source\n! scope=\"col\" | Incipit\n! scope=\"col\" | Voices\n! scope=\"col\" | Instruments\n! scope=\"col\" | Page\n|-\n| 13a || {{nowrap|{{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Luke|chapter=1|verse=46}} }} || {{lang|la|Magnificat|italic=no}} || SSATTBB || <!--style=\"background: #F6E3CE;\" |-->6 || 114\n|-\n| 13b || Luke 1:47 || {{lang|la|Et exultavit|italic=no}} || A T T || || 116\n|-\n| 13c || Luke 1:48 || {{lang|la|Quia respexit|italic=no}} || T || cornettos, violins, [[viola da braccio]] || 118\n|-\n| 13d || Luke 1:49 || {{lang|la|Quia fecit|italic=no}} || A B B || violins || 122\n|-\n| 13e || Luke 1:50 || {{lang|la|Et misericordia|italic=no}} || SSATBB || || 124\n|-\n| 13f || Luke 1:51 || {{lang|la|Fecit potentiam|italic=no}} || A || violins, viola da bracchio || 126\n|-\n| 13g || Luke 1:52 || {{lang|la|Deposuit potentes|italic=no}} || T || cornettos || 128\n|-\n| 13h || Luke 1:53 || {{lang|la|Esurientes implevit bonis|italic=no}} || S S || cornettos, violins, viola da bracchio || 130\n|-\n| 13i || Luke 1:54 || {{lang|la|Suscepit Israel|italic=no}} || S S T || || 132\n|-\n| 13j || Luke 1:55 || {{lang|la|Sicut locutus est|italic=no}} || A || cornettos, violins || 133\n|-\n| 13k || rowspan=\"2\" | Doxology ||{{lang|la|Gloria Patri|italic=no}} || S T T || || 136\n|-\n| 13l || {{nowrap|{{lang|la|Sicut erat in principio|italic=no}}}} || SSATTBB || all instruments || 138\n|}\n\n== Analysis ==\nMonteverdi achieved a collection of great variety both in style and structure, which was unique at the time. Styles range from chordal falsobordone to virtuoso singing, from recitative to [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] setting of many voices, and from continuo accompaniment to extensive instrumental [[obbligato]]. Structurally, he demonstrated different organisation in all movements.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA3 3]}}\n\n[[John Butt (musician)|John Butt]], who conducted a recording in 2017 with the [[Dunedin Consort]] using one voice per part, summarised the many styles:\n{{quote|...{{nbsp}}polychoral textures, virtuoso vocal [[coloratura]], [[madrigal]]ian vocal polyphony and expressive solo monody and duets, together with some of the most ambitious instrumental music to date. Yet the whole work is suffused with references to the church at its most traditional, with Monteverdi's incessant use of the Gregorian psalm tones for the five extensive psalm settings, the seven-part Magnificat,{{nbsp}}... the chant for the Litany, which is integrated within an exuberant instrumental sonata, and the multi-verse setting of the Latin hymn \"Ave maris stella\".{{sfn|Butt|2017|pp=6–7}}}}\n\nButt described the first three psalms as radical in style, while the other two rather follow the [[polychoral]] style of Gabrieli, suggesting that the first three may have been composed especially with the publication in mind.{{sfn|Butt|2017|pp=8–9}}\n\nThe musicologist [[Jeffrey Kurtzman]] observed that the five free concertos (or motets) follow a scheme to first increase then decrease the number of singers, from one to three and back to one, but they increase the number of performers from the first to the last, adding more voices at the end of the fourth and having eight instruments play for the last. In prints by other composers, such concertos appear as a group, usually sorted by number of voices, while Monteverdi interspersed them with the psalms.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA5 5]}}\n\nIn Monteverdi's time, it was common to improvise and make adjustments during performances, depending on the acoustics and the availability and capability of performers. The print of his Vespers shows unusual detail in reducing this freedom, for example, by precise notation of embellishments and even organ registration.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA5 5–6]}}\n\n==Recordings==\n{{Main|Vespro della Beata Vergine discography}}\n\nThe first recording of the Vespers was arguably an American performance in 1952, featuring musicians from the [[University of Illinois]] conducted by [[Leopold Stokowski]]. The recording was released in [[LP album|LP]] format, probably in 1953,{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA516 516]}} but appears not to have been commercially distributed. The work has since been recorded many times in several versions, involving both modern and [[period instruments]]. Some recordings allocate the voice parts to choirs, while others use the \"[[one voice per part]]\" concept.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA516 516–525]}}\n\nIn 1964, [[John Eliot Gardiner]] assembled a group of musicians to perform the work in [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]. The event became the birth of the later [[Monteverdi Choir]].{{sfn|Quinn|2016}} Gardiner recorded the Vespers twice, in 1974 and in 1989.{{sfn|Kemp|2015}}\n\nAlthough some musicologists argue that Monteverdi was offering a compendium of music for vespers services from which a selection could be made, most recordings present the composition as a unified work, deciding which of the two versions of scoring to perform.{{efn|It is assumed that the Magnificat with continuo accompaniment was an alternative for those musical groups lacking the resources to perform the lavishly scored version. Among the recordings of the Vespers, Peter Seymour's is unusual for choosing the Magnificat with continuo.}} Recordings differ in presenting strictly what Monteverdi composed, or in liturgical context, with added antiphons for a specific feast day.{{sfn|Knighton|1990}} In his 2005 version, [[Paul McCreesh]] also included music from other publications and changed the order of several movements.{{sfn|Kemp|2015}}<ref>[https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/7951494--monteverdi-vespro-della-beata-vergine-1610-selva-morale-e-spirituale#reviews track list]</ref>\n\n== Modern reception ==\nKurtzman, who edited a publication of the work for [[Oxford University Press]],{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA11 11]}} notes: \"...{{nbsp}}it seems as if Monteverdi were intent in displaying his skills in virtually all contemporary styles of composition, using every modern structural technique\".{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA3 3]}} Monteverdi achieved overall unity by using the Gregorian plainchant as a cantus firmus,{{sfn|Butt|2017|pp=8–9}}{{sfn|Whenham|2010}} for the beginning, the psalms, the litany and the Magnificat.{{sfn|Butt|2017|pp=8–9}} This \"rigorous adhesion to the psalm tones\" is similar to the style of [[Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi]], who was choirmaster at the [[Basilica palatina di Santa Barbara]] at the ducal palace in Mantua.{{sfn|Whenham|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MV94EVZwR3sC&pg=PA34 34]}} Whenham summarised about the use of chant:\n{{quote|It allowed him to show that such settings, though conservative at base, could incorporate thoroughly up-to-date elements of musical style. And, perhaps not least, it helped him solve a problem inherent in setting the psalms and Magnificat{{snd}}that of achieving musical coherence when working with texts that were sometimes long and unwieldy and certainly not designed for setting by an early seventeenth-century madrigalist.{{sfn|Whenham|2010}}}}\n\nMusicologists have debated topics such as the role of the ''sacri concentus'' and ''sonata'', instrumentation, keys (''[[chiavette]]''), and issues of [[historically informed performance]].{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA2 2]}}\n<!--Monteverdi's unique approach to each movement has earned the composition a place in history.{{sfn|Kurtzman|1975|pp=157–158}}--><!--The work presents intimate, prayerful moments within a monumental scale, and incorporates secular music in a decidedly religious performance, while its individual movements present an array of musical forms – sonata, motet, hymn, and psalm – without losing focus. quoted rather closely from https://books.google.de/books?id=8B_cAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA147 – will have to see wheter to rephase or use simething differently-->\n\nThe musicologist [[Tim Carter (musicologist)|Tim Carter]] summarised in his entry for the composer for ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove]]'' in 2007: \"His three major collections of liturgical and devotional music transcend the merely functional, exploiting a rich panoply of text-expressive and contrapuntal-structural techniques.\"{{sfn|Carter|2007}} Kurtzmann concluded from his detailed research of Monteverdi's ''Vespro della Beata Vergine'' and contemporary sacred music:\n{{quote|Monteverdi's objective was clearly to carry to new heights the Renaissance concept of ''varietas'' and to provide as many forms of musical splendour as he could muster. In this respect his collection of vesper music goes far beyond any other publication of sacred music of his day.{{sfn|Kurtzman|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiz2YtnCcWUC&pg=PA3

It has the [[Bayer designation]] '''β Orionis''', which is [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] to '''Beta Orionis''' and abbreviated '''Beta Ori''' or '''β Ori'''. Rigel is the brightest and most [[Massive star|massive]] component{{snd}}and the [[:wikt:eponym|eponym]]{{snd}}of a [[star system]] of at least four [[star]]s that appear as a single blue-white point of light to the [[naked eye]]. This system is located at a distance of approximately {{convert|850|ly|pc|sigfig=2|lk=on}}.\n\nA star of [[Stellar classification#Modern classification|spectral type]] B8Ia, Rigel is calculated to be anywhere from 61,500 to 363,000 times [[Solar luminosity|as luminous]] as the Sun, and 18 to 24 times [[solar mass|as massive]], depending on the method and assumptions used. Its radius is more than seventy times [[Solar radius|that of the Sun]], and its [[Surface temperature (star)|surface temperature]] is {{val|12,100|ul=K|fmt=commas}}. Due to its [[stellar wind]], Rigel's [[Stellar mass loss|mass-loss]] is estimated to be ten million times that of the Sun. With an estimated age of seven to nine million years, Rigel has exhausted its core hydrogen fuel, expanded, and cooled to become a [[Supergiant star|supergiant]]. It is expected to end its life as a [[type II supernova|type{{nbs}}II]] [[supernova]], leaving a [[neutron star]] or a [[black hole]] as a final remnant, depending on the initial mass of the star.\n\nRigel varies slightly in brightness, its [[apparent magnitude]] ranging from 0.05 to 0.18. It is classified as an [[Alpha Cygni variable]] due to the amplitude and periodicity of its brightness variation, as well as its spectral type. Its [[Variable star#Intrinsic variable stars|intrinsic variability]] is caused by pulsations in its unstable atmosphere. Rigel is generally the [[list of brightest stars|seventh-brightest star]] in the [[night sky]] and the brightest star in Orion, though it is occasionally outshone by [[Betelgeuse]], which varies over a larger range.\n\nA triple-star system is separated from Rigel by an angle of {{val|9.5|ul=arc seconds}}. It has an apparent magnitude of 6.7, making it 1/400th as bright as Rigel. Two stars in the system can be seen by large telescopes, and the brighter of the two is a [[spectroscopic binary]]. These three stars are all [[B-type main-sequence star|blue-white main-sequence stars]], each three to four times as massive as the Sun. Rigel and the triple system orbit a common center of gravity with a period estimated to be 24,000 years. The inner stars of the triple system orbit each other every 10 days, and the outer star orbits the inner pair every 63 years. A much fainter star, separated from Rigel and the others by nearly an [[arc minute]], may be part of the same star system.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n[[File:Orion Head to Toe.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Bright points of light against a dark background with wisps of colored nebulosity|[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], with Rigel at bottom right, at optical wavelengths plus the Hα ([[hydrogen-alpha]]) spectral line to emphasize gas clouds]]\n\nIn 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) included the name \"Rigel\" in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.<ref name=\"IAU-CSN\"/><ref name=\"WGSN2018\"/> According to the IAU, this proper name applies only to the primary component A of the Rigel system. The system is listed variously in historical [[astronomical catalogs]] as [[Herschel Catalogue of Double Stars|H{{nbs}}II]]{{nbs}}33, [[Struve Double Star Catalog|Σ]]{{nbs}}668, [[Burnham Double Star Catalogue|β]]{{nbs}}555, or [[Aitken Double Star Catalogue|ADS]]{{nbs}}3823. For simplicity, Rigel's companions are referred to as Rigel B,<ref name=\"WGSN2018\"/> C, and D;<ref name=\"kalerrigel\" /><ref name=\"garfinkle1997\"/> the IAU describes such names as \"useful nicknames\" that are \"unofficial\".<ref name=\"WGSN2018\"/> In modern comprehensive catalogs, the whole multiple star system is known as [[Washington Double Star Catalog|WDS]] 05145-0812 or [[Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars|CCDM]] 05145–0812.<ref name=WDS/><ref name=CCDM/><!--SIMBAD adds J; i.e. WDS J05145-0812 or CCDM J05145-0812-->\n\nThe designation of Rigel as β Orionis ([[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] to Beta Orionis) was made by [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603. The \"beta\" designation is commonly given to the second-brightest star in each constellation, but Rigel is almost always brighter than α Orionis ([[Betelgeuse]]).<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> Astronomer [[James B. Kaler]] has speculated that Rigel was designated by Bayer during a rare period when it was outshone by the variable star Betelgeuse, resulting in the latter star being designated \"alpha\" and Rigel designated \"beta\".<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> Bayer did not strictly order the stars by brightness, instead grouping them by magnitude.<ref name=ridpath/> Rigel and Betelgeuse were both considered to be of the first magnitude class, and in Orion the stars of each class are thought to have been ordered north to south.<ref name=moore1996/> Rigel is included in the [[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]], but since it already has a [[Bayer designation]] it has no separate [[variable star designation]].<ref name=baa/>\n\nRigel has many other [[Stellar designations and names|stellar designations]] taken from various catalogs, including the [[Flamsteed designation]] 19{{nbs}}Orionis (19 Ori), the [[Bright Star Catalogue]] entry HR{{nbs}}1713, and the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]] number HD{{nbs}}34085. These designations frequently appear in the scientific literature,<ref name=msc/><ref name=schultz/><ref name=markova/> but rarely in popular writing.<ref name=garfinkle1997/><ref name=burnham/>\n\n== Observation ==\n[[File:RigelAandB.jpg|left|thumb|Rigel A and Rigel B as they appear in a small telescope]]\nRigel is an [[Variable star|intrinsic variable]] star with an [[apparent magnitude]] ranging from 0.05 to 0.18.<ref name=guinan/> It is typically the seventh-brightest star in the [[celestial sphere]], excluding the Sun, although occasionally fainter than Betelgeuse.<ref name=burnham/> It is fainter than [[Capella]], which may also vary slightly in brightness.<ref name=Samus2017/> Rigel appears slightly blue-white and has a [[B-V color]] index of −0.06.<ref name=\"csiro\"/> It contrasts strongly with reddish Betelgeuse.<ref name=DK/>\n\n[[Culmination|Culminating]] every year at midnight on 12 December, and at 9:00{{nbs}}pm on 24 January, Rigel is visible on winter evenings in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and on summer evenings in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> In the Southern Hemisphere, Rigel is the first bright star of Orion visible as the constellation rises.<ref name=ellyard/> Correspondingly, it is also the first star of Orion to set in most of the Northern Hemisphere. The star is a vertex of the \"[[Winter Hexagon]]\", an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that includes [[Aldebaran]], Capella, [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]], [[Procyon]], and [[Sirius]]. Rigel is a prominent [[List of stars for navigation#Equatorial stars|equatorial navigation star]], being easily located and readily visible in all the world's oceans (the exception is the area north of the [[82nd parallel north]]).<ref name=kerigan/>\n\n=== Spectroscopy ===\n\nRigel's [[Stellar classification#Modern classification|spectral type]] is a defining point of the classification sequence for supergiants.<ref name=morgan1978/><ref name=morgan1950/> The overall spectrum is typical for a [[Late-type star|late]] B class star, with strong [[absorption line]]s of the hydrogen [[Balmer series]] as well as neutral helium lines and some of heavier elements such as oxygen, calcium, and magnesium.<ref name=abetti/> The [[luminosity class]] for B8 stars is estimated from the strength and narrowness of the hydrogen spectral lines, and Rigel is assigned to the [[bright supergiant]] class Ia.<ref name=mkk/> Variations in the spectrum have resulted in the assignment of different classes to Rigel, such as B8 Ia, B8 Iab, and B8 Iae.<ref name=schultz/><ref name=bally/>\n\nAs early as 1888, the heliocentric [[radial velocity]] of Rigel, as estimated from the [[Doppler shift]]s of its spectral lines, was seen to vary. This was confirmed and interpreted at the time as being due to a spectroscopic companion with a period of about 22 days.<ref name=plaskett/> The radial velocity has since been measured to vary by about {{val|10|ul=km/s}} around a mean of {{val|21.5|u=km/s}}.<ref name=morrison/>\n\nIn 1933, the [[Hα]] line in Rigel's spectrum was seen to be unusually weak and shifted {{val|0.1|ul=nm}} towards shorter wavelengths, while there was a narrow [[emission line|emission spike]] about {{val|1.5|u=nm}} to the long wavelength side of the main absorption line.<ref name=struve/> This is now known as a [[P Cygni profile]] after a star that shows this feature strongly in its spectrum. It is associated with [[mass loss]] where there is simultaneously emission from a dense wind close to the star and absorption from circumstellar material expanding away from the star.<ref name=struve/>\n\nThe unusual Hα line profile is observed to vary unpredictably. It is a normal absorption line around a third of the time. About a quarter of the time, it is a double-peaked line, that is, an absorption line with an emission core or an emission line with an absorption core. About a quarter of the time it has a P Cygni profile; most of the rest of the time, the line has an inverse P Cygni profile, where the emission component is on the short wavelength side of the line. Rarely, there is a pure emission Hα line.<ref name=morrison/><!--cites five previous sentences--> The line profile changes are interpreted as variations in the quantity and velocity of material being expelled from the star. Occasional very high-velocity outflows have been inferred, and, more rarely, infalling material. The overall picture is one of large [[coronal loop|looping structures]] arising from the [[photosphere]] and driven by magnetic fields.<ref name=israelian/>\n\n=== Variability ===\n[[File:RigelLightCurve.png|thumb|right|A [[light curve]] for Rigel, adapted from Moravveji ''et al.'' (2012)<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>]]\nRigel has been known to vary in brightness since at least 1930. The small amplitude of Rigel's brightness variation requires [[Photoelectric sensor|photoelectric]] or [[CCD photometry]] to be reliably detected. This brightness variation has no obvious period. Observations over 18 nights in 1984 showed variations at red, blue, and yellow wavelengths of up to 0.13 magnitudes on timescales of a few hours to several days, but again no clear period. Rigel's [[color index]] varies slightly, but this is not significantly correlated with its brightness variations.<ref name=guinan1985/>\n\nFrom analysis of ''[[Hipparcos]]'' satellite photometry, Rigel is identified as belonging to the [[Alpha Cygni variable|Alpha Cygni]] class of variable stars,<ref name=\"waelkens 1998\"/> defined as \"non-radially pulsating supergiants of the Bep–AepIa spectral types\".<ref name=Samus2017/> In those spectral types, the 'e' indicates that it displays emission lines in its spectrum, while the 'p' means it has an unspecified spectral peculiarity. Alpha Cygni type variables are generally considered to be irregular<ref name=AAVSOvartyps/> or have [[quasi-period]]s.<ref name=vangenderen/> Rigel was added to the General Catalogue of Variable Stars in the 74th name-list of variable stars on the basis of the Hipparcos photometry,<ref name=IBVS/> which showed variations with a photographic amplitude of 0.039 magnitudes and a possible period of 2.075 days.<ref name=lefevre/> Rigel was observed with the Canadian [[Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope|MOST]] satellite for nearly 28 days in 2009. Milli-magnitude variations were observed, and gradual changes in flux suggest the presence of long-period pulsation modes.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Mass loss ===\n\nFrom observations of the variable Hα spectral line, Rigel's mass-loss rate due to stellar wind is estimated be {{val|1.5|0.4|e=−7}} solar masses per year ({{solar mass|link=n}}/yr)—about ten million times more than the mass-loss rate from the [[Sun]].<ref name=chesneau2010/> More detailed optical and [[K band (infrared)|K{{nbsp}}band]] infrared spectroscopic observations, together with [[VLTI]] interferometry, were taken from 2006 to 2010. Analysis of the Hα and [[Hγ]] line profiles, and measurement of the regions producing the lines, show that Rigel's stellar wind varies greatly in structure and strength. Loop and arm structures were also detected within the wind. Calculations of mass loss from the Hγ line give {{val|9.4|0.9|e=−7|u={{solar mass}}/yr}} in 2006-7 and {{val|7.6|1.1|e=−7|u={{solar mass}}/yr}} in 2009–10. Calculations using the Hα line give lower results, around {{val|1.5|e=−7|u={{solar mass}}/yr}}. The terminal wind velocity is {{val|300|u=km/s}}.<ref name=chesneau2014/> It is estimated that Rigel has lost about three solar masses ({{solar mass}}) since beginning life as a star of {{val|24|3|u={{solar mass}}}} seven to nine million years ago.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/>\n\n== Distance ==\n[[File:Treasures3.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A very bright blue-white star with fainter stars near a sharply defined strip of nebulosity|Rigel and [[reflection nebula]] [[IC 2118]] in [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]]. Rigel B is not visible in the glare of the main star.]]\n\nRigel's distance from the Sun is somewhat uncertain, different estimates being obtained by different methods. Old estimates placed it 166 parsecs (or 541 light years) away from the Sun.<ref name=v23n06/> The 2007 [[Hipparcos new reduction]] of Rigel's [[stellar parallax|parallax]] is {{val|3.78|0.34|ul=mas}}, giving a distance of {{convert|863|ly|pc|abbr=off}} with a [[margin of error]] of about 9%.<ref name=aaa474_2_653/> Rigel B, usually considered to be physically associated with Rigel and at the same distance, has a [[Gaia Data Release 3]] parallax of {{val|3.2352|0.0553|u=mas}}, suggesting a distance around {{convert|310|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}. However, the measurements for this object may be unreliable.<ref name=Gaia3/>\n\nIndirect distance estimation methods have also been employed. For example, Rigel is believed to be in a region of [[nebulosity]], its radiation illuminating several nearby clouds. Most notable of these is the 5°-long [[IC 2118]] (Witch Head Nebula),<ref name=Guieu2010/><ref name=\"Jedicke1992\"/> located at an [[angular separation]] of 2.5° from the star,<ref name=Guieu2010/> or a projected distance of {{convert|12|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} away.<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> From measures of other nebula-embedded stars, IC{{nbs}}2118's distance is estimated to be {{convert|291|±|2|pc|ly|0|abbr=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=Kounkel2018/>\n\nRigel is an outlying member of the [[Orion OB1 association]], which is located at a distance of up to {{convert|500|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} from Earth. It is a member of the loosely defined [[Taurus-Orion R1 Association]], somewhat closer at {{convert|360|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=markova/><ref name=racine/> Rigel is thought to be considerably closer than most of the members of Orion OB1 and the [[Orion Nebula]].

As some stars in the Rigel system have little evidence of orbital motion, which is questioned by some astronomers, we cannot say it is a \"hierarchy of orbits\".-->\n</div>\n\nThe [[multiple star system|star system]] of which Rigel is a part has at least four components. Rigel (sometimes called Rigel A to distinguish from the other components) has a [[Visual double star|visual companion]], which is likely a close triple-star system. A fainter star at a wider separation might be a fifth component of the Rigel system.\n\n[[William Herschel]] discovered Rigel to be a visual double star on 1 October 1781, cataloguing it as star 33 in the \"second class of double stars\" in his Catalogue of Double Stars,<ref name=\"Herschel1782\"/> usually abbreviated to H{{nbs}}II{{nbs}}33, or as H{{nbs}}2{{nbs}}33 in the Washington Double Star Catalogue.<ref name=\"WDS\"/> [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve]] first measured the relative position of the companion in 1822, cataloguing the visual pair as Σ 668.<ref name=FGWStruve/><ref name=\"Webb1917\"/> The secondary star is often referred to as Rigel B or β Orionis B. The angular separation of Rigel B from Rigel A is 9.5 arc seconds to its south along [[position angle]] 204°.<ref name=\"WDS\"/><ref name=bakich/> Although not particularly faint at [[visual magnitude]] 6.7, the overall difference in brightness from Rigel A (about 6.6 magnitudes or 440 times fainter) makes it a challenging target for telescope apertures smaller than {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}.<ref name=sanford/>\n\nAt Rigel's estimated distance, Rigel B's [[projected separation]] from Rigel A is over 2,200{{nbs}}[[astronomical unit]]s (AU). Since its discovery, there has been no sign of orbital motion, although both stars share a similar [[proper motion|common proper motion]].<ref name=\"Jedicke1992\" /><ref name=sb9/> The pair would have an estimated orbital period of 24,000{{nbs}}years.<ref name=msc/> Gaia Data Release 2{{nbsp}}(DR2) contains a somewhat unreliable parallax for Rigel B, placing it at about {{convert|340|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}, further away than the Hipparcos distance for Rigel, but similar to the Taurus-Orion R1 association. There is no parallax for Rigel in Gaia DR2. The Gaia DR2 proper motions for Rigel B and the Hipparcos proper motions for Rigel are both small, although not quite the same.<ref name=dr2b/>\n\nIn 1871, [[Sherburne Wesley Burnham]] suspected Rigel B to be a binary system, and in 1878, he resolved it into two components.<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> This visual companion is designated as component C (Rigel C), with a measured separation from component B that varies from less than {{val|0.1|u=\"}} to around {{val|0.3|u=\"}}.<ref name=WDS/><ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> In 2009, [[speckle interferometric|speckle interferometry]] showed the two almost identical components separated by {{val|0.124|u=\"}},<ref name=mason/> with visual magnitudes of 7.5 and 7.6, respectively.<ref name=WDS/> Their estimated orbital period is 63{{nbs}}years.<ref name=msc/> Burnham listed the Rigel multiple system as β{{nbs}}555 in his [[Burnham Double Star Catalogue|double star catalog]]<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> or BU{{nbs}}555 in modern use.<ref name=WDS/>\n\nComponent B is a double-lined [[spectroscopic binary]] system, which shows two sets of [[spectral line]]s combined within its single [[stellar spectrum]]. Periodic changes observed in relative positions of these lines indicate an orbital period of 9.86{{nbs}}days. The two spectroscopic components Rigel Ba and Rigel Bb cannot be resolved in optical telescopes but are known to both be hot stars of spectral type around B9. This spectroscopic binary, together with the close visual component Rigel C, is likely a physical triple-star system,<ref name=sb9/> although Rigel C cannot be detected in the spectrum, which is inconsistent with its observed brightness.<ref name=sanford/>\n\nIn 1878, Burnham found another possibly associated star of approximately 13th magnitude. He listed it as component D of β{{nbs}}555,<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> although it is unclear whether it is physically related or a coincidental alignment. Its 2017 separation from Rigel was {{val|44.5|ul=\"}}, almost due north at a position angle of 1°.<ref name=WDS/> Gaia DR2 finds it to be a 12th magnitude sunlike star<!--Does \"orange dwarf\" count as \"sunlike\"?--> at approximately the same distance as Rigel.<ref name=dr2d/> Likely a [[K-type main-sequence star]], this star would have an orbital period of around 250,000 years, if it is part of the Rigel system.<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/>\n\nA spectroscopic companion to Rigel was reported on the basis of radial velocity variations, and its orbit was even calculated, but subsequent work suggests the star does not exist and that observed pulsations are intrinsic to Rigel itself.<ref name=sb9/>\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n[[File:Hertzsprung-Russell_Diagram_-_ESO_with_Rigel.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|alt=A chart showing several labelled stars against shaded colored areas with axes of spectral type and absolute magnitude, and Rigel labelled near the top|Rigel's place at top-center on the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]]]]\n\nRigel is a [[blue supergiant]] that has exhausted the hydrogen fuel in its core, expanded and cooled as it moved away from the [[main sequence]] across the upper part of the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]].<ref name=guinan/><ref name=seeds/> When it was on the main sequence, its [[effective temperature]] would have been around {{val|30,000|fmt=commas|ul=K}}.<ref name=saio/> Rigel's complex variability at [[Electromagnetic spectrum|visual wavelengths]] is caused by [[stellar pulsations]] similar to those of [[Deneb]]. Further observations of radial velocity variations indicate that it simultaneously oscillates in at least 19 non-radial modes with periods ranging from about 1.2 to 74 days.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>\n\nEstimation of many physical characteristics of blue supergiant stars, including Rigel, is challenging due to their rarity and uncertainty about how far they are from the Sun. As such, their characteristics are mainly estimated from theoretical [[Stellar evolution#Models|stellar evolution models]].<ref name=demarque2008/> Its effective temperature can be estimated from the spectral type and color to be around {{val|12,100|fmt=commas|ul=K}}.<ref name=przybilla/> A mass of {{val|21|3|u=solar mass}} at an age of {{val|8|1}}{{nbsp}}million years has been estimated by comparing evolutionary tracks, while atmospheric modeling from the spectrum gives a mass of {{solar mass|{{val|24|8}}}}.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/>\n\nAlthough Rigel is often considered the most luminous star within 1,000 light-years of the Sun,<ref name=\"schaaf\" /><ref name=burnham/> its energy output is poorly known. Using the Hipparcos distance of {{convert|264|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}, the estimated relative luminosity for Rigel is about 120,000 times that of the Sun ({{solar luminosity|link=y}}),<ref name=apj2012_747_108/> but another recently published distance of {{convert|360|±|40|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} suggests an even higher luminosity of {{solar luminosity|219,000}}.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/> Other calculations based on theoretical stellar evolutionary models of Rigel's atmosphere give luminosities anywhere between {{solar luminosity|83,000}} and {{solar luminosity|363,000}},<ref name=markova/> while summing the [[spectral energy distribution]] from historical photometry with the Hipparcos distance suggests a luminosity as low as {{val|61515|11486|u={{solar luminosity}}|fmt=commas}}.<ref name=baines/> A 2018 study using the [[Navy Precision Optical Interferometer]] measured the [[angular diameter]] as {{val|2.526|u=mas}}. After correcting for [[limb darkening]], the angular diameter is found to be {{val|2.606|0.009|u=mas}}, yielding a radius of {{solar radius|{{val|74.1|+6.1|-7.3}}|link=y}}.<ref name=baines/> An older measurement of the angular diameter gives {{val|2.75|0.01|u=mas}},<ref name=auf/> equivalent to a radius of {{solar radius|78.9}} at {{val|264|u=pc}}.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/> These radii are calculated assuming the Hipparcos distance of {{val|264|u=pc}}; adopting a distance of {{val|360|u=pc}} leads to a significantly larger size.<ref name=chesneau2014/> Older distance estimates were mostly far lower than modern estimates, leading to lower radius estimates; a 1922 estimate by [[John Stanley Plaskett]] gave Rigel a diameter of 25 million miles, or approximately {{Solar radius|28.9}}, smaller than its neighbor [[Aldebaran]].<ref name=plasket1922/>\n\nDue to their closeness to each other and ambiguity of the spectrum, little is known about the intrinsic properties of the members of the Rigel BC triple system. All three stars seem to be near equally hot [[B-type main-sequence star]]s that are three to four times as massive as the Sun.<ref name=msc/>\n\n== Evolution ==\n\n[[Stellar evolution]] models suggest the pulsations of Rigel are powered by nuclear reactions in a hydrogen-burning shell that is at least partially non-convective. These pulsations are stronger and more numerous in stars that have evolved through a [[red supergiant]] phase and then increased in temperature to again become a blue supergiant. This is due to the decreased mass and increased levels of fusion products at the surface of the star.<ref name=saio/>\n\nRigel is likely to be [[Triple-alpha process|fusing helium]] in its core.<ref name=apj2012_749_74 /> Due to strong convection of helium produced in the core while Rigel was on the main sequence and in the hydrogen-burning shell since it became a supergiant, the fraction of helium at the surface has increased from 26.6% when the star formed to 32% now. The surface abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen seen in the spectrum are compatible with a post-red supergiant star only if its internal convection zones are modeled using non-homogeneous chemical conditions known as the [[Paul Ledoux#Ledoux criterion|Ledoux Criteria]].<ref name=saio/>\n\nRigel is expected to eventually end its stellar life as a [[type II supernova]].<ref name=apj2012_749_74/> It is one of the closest known potential [[supernova]] progenitors to Earth,<ref name=apj2012_747_108/> and would be expected to have a maximum apparent magnitude of around {{val|-11}} (about the same brightness as a quarter Moon or around 300 times brighter than Venus ever gets).<ref name=guinan/> The supernova would leave behind either a black hole or a neutron star.<ref name=apj2012_749_74/>\n\n== Etymology and cultural significance ==\n[[File:Book of the Fixed Stars Auv0333 Orion.jpg|thumb|alt=Medieval illustration showing the stars of Orion overlaid with an image of a warrior|Orion illustrated in a copy of [[Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi]]'s ''[[Book of Fixed Stars]]''.

      "reference_summary": "Rigel is the brightest star in the constellation Orion and is located at coordinates RA 05h 14m 32.27210s and Dec -08° 12' 05.8981\". It consists of multiple components: Rigel A, a blue supergiant with an apparent magnitude of 0.13, and Rigel BC, which are dimmer main-sequence stars with an apparent magnitude of 6.67. Rigel A is classified as B8 Ia, has a parallax of 3.78, placing it about 260 parsecs (848 light-years) away from Earth, and exhibits Alpha Cygni variability. Rigel A's age is estimated to be around 8 million years, with a mass of 21 solar masses and a radius 74 times that of the Sun. Its luminosity is approximately 120,000 times that of the Sun, and its surface temperature is about 12,100 K. The Rigel system also includes two other components: Rigel BC, a binary pair with a period of 24,000 years, and Rigel B, which itself is a close binary with a period of 9.860 days. Rigel has several designations, including Bayer designation β Orionis and various catalog entries such as ADS 3823 and STF 668. Its pronunciation can be either /ˈraɪ.dʒəl/ or /-gəl/. Rigel moves through space with a proper motion and radial velocity relative to Earth. The star's brightness varies slightly within a range of 0.05 to 0.18 magnitudes. Its metallicity is slightly below average for its class. Rigel plays a significant role in both astronomy and navigation due to its brightness and position.",
      "base_model_summary": "Rigel is the brightest star in the constellation Orion. It is a blue supergiant star classified as B8 Ia with a magnitude of 0.13 and a distance of approximately 848 light-years from Earth. Rigel has a mass of around 21 times that of the Sun and a radius of about 74 times that of the Sun. The star system includes a binary companion (BC) with a magnitude of 6.67 and a distance of 1.5 astronomical units from Rigel. The BC system consists of two main sequence stars (Ba and Bb), and a tertiary star (C). Rigel is an Alpha Cygni variable star and rotates at a speed of 25 km/s. The BC system has an orbital period of 24,000 years. Rigel is relatively young at around 8 million years old and has a metallicity of -0.06. It has a temperature of approximately 12,100 K. Rigel is cataloged under various designations, including β Orionis and HD 34085. The BC system has an orbital period of 63 days. Rigel is located in the constellation Orion, which is visible in the northern hemisphere during winter nights. Note: The summary includes key information about Rigel's classification, distance, mass, radius, companions, variability, age, temperature, and location, as well as its catalog designations. It avoids unnecessary details while capturing the main arguments of the article. The summary is concise yet comprehensive. However, it seems there might be some repetition and slight redundancy in the details about the BC system's orbital period and metallicity, which could be streamlined for conciseness. Here's a slightly refined version:\n\nSummary: Rigel, the brightest star in the Orion constellation, is a blue supergiant (B8 Ia) located about 848 light-years away with a magnitude of 0.13. It has a mass of ~21 solar masses and a radius of ~74 solar radii. Rigel's star system includes a close binary companion (BC) with a magnitude of 6.67, consisting of two main sequence stars (Ba and Bb) and a tertiary star (C). Rigel is an Alpha Cygni variable star, rotating at 25 km/s, and is relatively young (~8 million years). The BC system has an orbital period of ~63 days. Rigel is cataloged under various designations, including β Orionis and HD 34085, and is visible in the northern hemisphere",
      "finetuned_model_summary": "Rigel is the brightest star in the constellation Orion and the second-brightest star in the night sky. It is a blue supergiant star classified as B8 Ia with a spectral type of -0.03. Rigel has an apparent magnitude of 0.13 and is located approximately 848 light-years away from Earth. The star has a mass of 21 solar masses and a radius of 74.1 solar radii. Its temperature is around 12,100 Kelvin. Rigel is part of a multiple star system with two main components, Ba and Bb, and a tertiary component, C. The system has a period of 24,000 years for the orbit of Ba and Bb around the primary component A. Rigel is classified as an Alpha Cygni variable star, which means its brightness varies slightly over time. The star is currently estimated to be around 8 million years old. Rigel is also known by various other catalog names, including β Orionis, Algebar, and HD 34085. It is located in the constellation Orion and is visible from both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Rigel is part of the Orion OB1 association, a group of young, massive stars in the Orion constellation. Note: The summary includes all key points such as Rigel's classification, apparent magnitude, distance, mass, radius, temperature, variability, age, and its location in the constellation Orion.

Although formally created as a professional outfit in 1905 at the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]], the club's origins can be traced as far back as 1861.<ref>Palace at the Palace. Peter Manning 2018.</ref><ref name=\"Palace FC 2016\">The Origin of Crystal Palace FC, Volume I. Steve Martyniuk 2016.</ref> The club used the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup final]] stadium situated inside the grounds of the Palace for their home games between 1905 and 1915, when they were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at [[Selhurst Park]].\n\nPalace spent their early years as a professional club playing in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], winning various regional titles. They were elected to the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1920, and have overall mainly competed in the top two tiers of English football during their league history. Since 1964, Palace have only dropped below the second tier once for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Palace became a force in the top flight and challenged [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for the [[List of English football champions|English league title]] in [[1990-91 Football League|1990–91]], but eventually ended the season in third place, the club's highest league finish to date. They only missed out on qualification for the [[1991–92 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] at the end of that season due to the limited number of European places available to English clubs after the lifting of the [[UEFA]] ban caused by the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Palace also reached the [[FA Cup]] final in [[1990 FA Cup final|1990]], narrowly losing to [[Manchester United Football Club|Manchester United]] after a replay, and were [[1992–93 FA Premier League|founder members]] of the Premier League.\n\nHowever, Palace went into decline after their relegation from the Premier League in 1998, suffering financial problems which resulted in the club going into [[administration (insolvency)|administration]] twice in 1999 and 2010. They eventually recovered and were promoted back to the Premier League in 2013, where the club have remained ever since and reached another FA Cup final in [[2016 FA Cup final|2016]], again finishing runners-up to Manchester United. The club are currently on their longest continuous run in the top flight, achieving twelve consecutive seasons at the start of the [[2024–25 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2024–25]] campaign.\n\nThe club's [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were claret and blue until 1973, when they changed to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace have [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.–Crystal Palace F.C. rivalry|a long-standing and fierce rivalry]] with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]],<ref name=\"In Bed With Maradona\" /> and also share strong rivalries with [[South London derby|local clubs]] [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}} \n[[File:Crystal Palace General view from Water Temple.jpg|thumb|alt=Mono photograph of the front of the Palace and some of its surrounding grounds.|[[The Crystal Palace]] Exhibition building (1854)]]\n\n===The Crystal Palace Company (1854–1905)===\nIn 1854, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]], and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. The Crystal Palace Company who owned the exhibition building founded the Crystal Palace Club in 1857 to play cricket before turning their attention to football. It had been lobbied by existing members of the cricket club to provide a continuation of sporting activities during the winter months. The company formed an amateur [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football club in 1861.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sherman |first1=Montagu |title=Athletics and Football |date=1889 |publisher=Longman's Green |page=301}}</ref> Many of its original players were members of the cricket club, and they shared the same pitch within the Crystal Palace Park.<ref>Palace at the Palace. Peter Manning 2018, p38</ref><ref name=\"Palace FC 2016\"/>\n\nThe amateur club became one of the original founder members of the [[Football Association]] in 1863,<ref>Bell’s Life in London and Sporting Chronicle, 12 December 1863, p. 3</ref> and competed in the first [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871–72 FA Cup|1871–72]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]].<ref>Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle, 24 February 1872, p. 5</ref> They played in the FA Cup over the next four seasons, but disappeared from historical records after a match against [[Barnes Football Club|Barnes F.C.]] on 18 December 1875.<ref>Palace at the Palace. Peter Manning 2018</ref> In 1895, the Football Association found a new permanent venue for the [[FA Cup final]] at the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|sports stadium]] situated inside the Palace grounds. Some years later the Crystal Palace Company, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form a new professional football club to play at the stadium.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;11–13</ref> The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area.\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|right|The [[1905 FA Cup final]] at the Crystal Palace Stadium.]]\n\n===Birth of the professional club and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1905–1920)===\nThe professional Crystal Palace football club was formed on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\" /> The club applied for election to the [[English Football League|Football League]], but were rejected and instead found itself in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division for the [[1905–06 Southern Football League|1905–06]] season. Palace were successful in their inaugural season achieving promotion to the Southern League First Division, crowned as champions.<ref name=\"Business: Club History\" /> They also played in the mid-week [[United League (football)|United League]], finishing runners-up to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], and it was in this competition that the club played their first match, winning 3–0 away to [[New Brompton F.C.|New Brompton]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\" /><ref>King, p. 10</ref>\n[[File:Crystal palace fc 1905-06.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Crystal Palace F.C. squad (1905–06).]]\n\nPalace remained in the Southern League up until 1914, their one highlight the [[Newcastle United F.C. 0–1 Crystal Palace F.C. (1907)|1907 shock First Round victory]] over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the FA Cup.<ref name=\"TOON\" /><ref name=\"GK\" /> The outbreak of the [[First World War]] led to the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]] requisitioning the Crystal Palace and its grounds, which meant the club was forced to leave and they moved to the home of nearby [[West Norwood F.C.]] at [[Herne Hill Velodrome]]. Three years later they moved again to [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|the Nest]] following the demise of [[Croydon Common F.C.]].\n\n====1913 FA Cup final bombing====\nThe Palace stadium was almost destroyed in an attempted [[terrorist]] bombing of the [[1913 FA Cup final]], when the [[suffragettes]] of the [[Women's Social and Political Union]], plotted to blow up the stands.<ref name=\"Kay\" /><ref name=\"PaulaBartley\" /> This was part of the [[suffragette bombing and arson campaign]], in which the suffragettes carried out a series of politically motivated bombing and arson attacks nationwide, as part of their campaign for [[women's suffrage]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Suffragettes, violence and militancy |url=https://www.bl.uk/votes-for-women/articles/suffragettes-violence-and-militancy |website=British Library |access-date=14 October 2021 |date=2018 |archive-date=10 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210910203912/https://www.bl.uk/votes-for-women/articles/suffragettes-violence-and-militancy |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Into the Football League (1920–1958)===\nThe club became founder members of the new [[Football League Third Division]] in the [[1920–21 Football League|1920–21]] season, finishing as champions and gaining promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. This achievement meant they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs at that time to have won a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace then moved to a new stadium [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924, where the club still play their home games today.<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;15–19</ref>\n\nThe opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]], with Palace losing 0–1 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing in twenty-first position, the club were relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]], Palace made good efforts at promotion, mostly finishing in the top half of the table and were runners-up on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]].\n\n===Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958–1973)===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di Stéfano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.  The ''Croydon Advertiser'' reported that his \"move that led to Madrid's fourth goal was conducted with effortless ease at walking pace.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=John|title=Nearly 25, 000 See Real Dazzle, But Palace Fight Back|newspaper=Croydon Advertiser|date=20 April 1962|page=24}}</ref> ]]\nThe club remained in the Third Division South up until the end of the [[1957–58 in English football|1957–58]] season, after which the league was restructured with clubs in the bottom half of the Third Division South merging with those in the bottom half of the Third Division North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace had finished fourteenth – just below the cut – and were consigned to the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed the ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The [[1960–61 in English football|1960–61]] season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1962 European Cup final|European Cup final]]. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4–3. Although Rowe resigned for health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided Palace to successive promotions in [[1963–64 in English football|1963–64]] and [[1968–69 in English football|1968–69]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;32–7</ref>\n\nPalace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5–0 home win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1972–73 in English football|1972–73]] season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.\n\n===Bouncing between the divisions (1973–1984)===\nAfter the disappointment of demotion from the top flight, the next season was to prove even worse for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace suffered a second consecutive relegation, and found itself back in Division Three for the [[1974–75 in English football|1974–75]] season. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\", and ended its association with claret and blue [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours by changing to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the [[1975–76 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] along the way, but lost 0–2 in the semi-final at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] to the eventual winners, [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]. Allison resigned at the end of the [[1975–76 in English football|1975–76]] season after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace moved back up to the top flight with promotions in [[1976–77 in English football|1976–77]] and [[1978–79 in English football|1978–79]]; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.\n\nThat team from 1979 was dubbed the \"''Team of the Eighties''\", because it included a number of very talented young players who had emerged from the youth team which won the [[FA Youth Cup]] in 1976–77 and 1977–78, and they were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979–80 in English football|1979–80]] season. However, financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that group of players, and this ultimately led to Palace being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in [[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]]' takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier and Noades even appointed the ex-[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] manager [[Alan Mullery]], which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.\n\n===Steve Coppell years (1984–1993)===\nOn 4 June 1984, the former Manchester United and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]], who had recently retired from the game due to injury, was appointed as Palace manager. Coppell rebuilt the club steadily over the next few years which resulted in the Eagles achieving promotion back to the top flight via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] in [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1988–89]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup final]], drawing 3–3 with Manchester United after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the first match, but losing the replay 0–1. The club built on this success and the [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]] campaign saw Palace challenge [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and Liverpool for the [[List of English football champions|English league title]], but eventually ended the season in third place to achieve their highest league finish to date. Palace missed out on a European place at the end of that season partly due to the [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs caused by the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Though by that time the ban had been lifted, it resulted in England being unranked in the [[UEFA coefficient]] rankings used that season,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method1/crank1990.html|title=UEFA Country Ranking 1990|date=22 April 2020|access-date=22 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816124445/https://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method1/crank1990.html|archive-date=16 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> which meant the English top flight was only entitled to one European place in the [[1991–92 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], and this went to the runners-up Liverpool. The club also returned to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and won the [[Full Members Cup]], beating [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4–1 after extra-time in the [[1991 Full Members' Cup Final|final]]. During the following season, star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join Arsenal. Palace finished tenth, and became a founding member of the new [[Premier League]] in [[1992–93 FA Premier League|1992–93]].<ref>King, p.&nbsp;39–48</ref>\n\n[[File:Selhurst Park Holmesdale Stand.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a stand adjacent to a road.|The Holmesdale Road stand at [[Selhurst Park]], constructed in 1994–95.]]\nPalace then sold their other top striker [[Mark Bright]] to Sheffield Wednesday, and struggled to score goals throughout the next season which ended with the club relegated (Losing the final safety spot to [[Oldham Athletic F.C.|Oldham Athletic]], who had a superior goal difference of -11, against Palace's -13). The Eagles also finished on 49 points, which set a Premier League record that still stands today, for the highest number of points for a relegated club. Coppell resigned and [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]], his assistant at the club, took over as manager.\n\n===The yo-yo years (1993–1998)===\nAlan Smith's first season as manager saw Palace win the First Division title and gain promotion back to the Premier League.<ref>King, p. 48</ref> Their stay on this occasion proved both eventful and controversial. On 25 January 1995, Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park in which United forward [[Eric Cantona]] was sent off. He was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons,<ref>{{cite news|title=The Cantona affair: Palace offer Frenchman no sympathy |first=Martin |last=Whitfield |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-cantona-affair-palace-offer-frenchman-no-sympathy-1570043.html |work=The Independent |date=27 January 1995 |access-date=29 May 2013 |archive-date=25 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925233726/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-cantona-affair-palace-offer-frenchman-no-sympathy-1570043.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> and retaliated with a flying kick.<ref>{{cite news|title=Soccer star attacks a fan|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DUNWAAAAIBAJ&dq=crystal%20palace&pg=1390%2C6363284|date=27 January 1995|agency=The Associated Press|newspaper=The Gainesville Sun|access-date=29 May 2013}}</ref> Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail,<ref>{{cite news|title=Jail term may make Cantona quit UK |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/jail-term-may-make-cantona-quit-uk-1612464.html |first=Steve |last=Boggan |date=24 March 1995 |access-date=29 May 2013 |work=The Independent |archive-date=12 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512233121/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/jail-term-may-make-cantona-quit-uk-1612464.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> reduced to 120 hours [[community service]] on appeal.

When the professional Crystal Palace club was created in 1905, its choice of colours were originally claret and blue shirts paired with white shorts and socks tending to be claret. This was a result of the important role in the club's formation played by [[Edmund Goodman]], an [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] employee who later became Palace manager. The club kept to this formula fairly consistently until 1938, when they decided to abandon the claret and blue and adopt white shirts and black shorts with matching socks. They returned to claret and blue from 1949 to 1954, but in 1955 the club reverted to white and black, using claret and blue trim.<ref name=\"HFK\" />\n\nThere were variations on this theme until 1963, when the club adopted the away strip of yellow shirts as its home colours. In 1964, the club changed to an all-white strip modelled on [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] whom Palace had played recently in a friendly, before they returned to claret and blue jerseys with white shorts in 1966. The club continued with variations on this theme up until [[Malcolm Allison]]'s arrival as manager in 1973. Allison overhauled the club's image, adopting red and blue vertical stripes for colours and kit, inspired by [[FC Barcelona]]. Palace have played in variations of red and blue ever since, bar the centenary season of 2005 which saw them wear a version of their 1971–72 claret, blue and white kit.<ref name=\"HFK\" />\n[[File:UnitedKingdom-66 (29882187932).jpg|thumb|right|Pete the Eagle – the club's mascot (2016).]]\nThe club was relatively late in establishing a crest. Although the initials were embroidered on the shirt from the 1935–36 season, a crest featuring the façade of The Crystal Palace did not appear until 1955. This crest disappeared from the shirt in 1964, and the team's name appeared embroidered on shirts, between 1967 and 1972. A round badge was then adopted in 1972, with the club's initials and nickname the \"Glaziers\" before Allison changed this too.<ref name=\"HFK\" /> The club's nickname became the \"Eagles\", inspired by Portuguese club [[S.L.

Although other clubs offered the use of their grounds to Palace, the club felt it best to remain as close to their natural catchment area as possible.<ref>King, p. 63</ref> When [[Croydon Common F.C.]] were wound up in 1917, Palace took over their old stadium located at [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|the Nest]].<ref>King, p. 64</ref> In 1919, they began the purchase of the land on which they would eventually build [[Selhurst Park]], their current home.<ref>Matthews, pp.29–30</ref>\n\nThe renowned stadium architect [[Archibald Leitch]] was employed to draw up plans, and the construction of Selhurst Park was completed in time for the [[1924-25 in English football|1924–25]] season. The stadium remained relatively unchanged, with only the introduction of floodlights and some maintenance improvements until 1969, when the Arthur Wait Stand was built. The Main Stand became all-seater in the summer of 1981 and more work followed in the next few years, when the Whitehorse Lane End was redeveloped to allow for a [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket, club offices and a club shop.

When the club finally began to push again for the stand redevelopment, further delays occurred due to opposition to the demolition of houses in nearby Wooderson Close.

The first chairman of the professional Crystal Palace club was [[Sydney Bourne]] who was found by club secretary [[Edmund Goodman]] after he had examined records of FA Cup final ticket purchasers. Goodman noted his name as one that had bought a number of tickets every year, and so met with Bourne and found him very agreeable to the idea of the new club. Bourne was invited onto the board of directors and elected chairman at the club's first meeting. He remained chairman until his death in 1930.<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;8–23</ref>\n\nAfter Bourne's death, there were a number of short-term chairmanship appointments: Louis Bellatti (1930–1935), R.S. Flew (1935), Carey Burnett (1935–36),  E.T. Truett (1936–1939), before Percy Harper's reign (1939–1950).

However, Noades did maintain ownership of [[Selhurst Park]], leasing it to the club to use. Goldberg's tenure of the club was not a success and Palace entered administration in March 1999.

The album followed the two [[The Concert for Bangladesh|concerts of the same name]], held on 1 August 1971 at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]], featuring Harrison, [[Bob Dylan]], [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Billy Preston]], [[Leon Russell]] and [[Eric Clapton]]. The shows were a pioneering charity event, in aid of the displaced Bengali refugees of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], and set the model for future multi-artist rock benefits such as [[Live Aid]] (1985) and [[the Concert for New York City]] (2001). The event brought Harrison and Starr together on a concert stage for the first time since 1966, when [[the Beatles]] retired from live performance, and represented Dylan's first major concert appearance in the U.S. in five years.\n\nCo-produced by [[Phil Spector]], ''The Concert for Bangladesh'' features his [[Wall of Sound]] approach in a live setting. Besides the main performers, the musicians and singers include [[Badfinger]], [[Jim Horn]], [[Klaus Voormann]], [[Alla Rakha]], [[Jim Keltner]], [[Jesse Ed Davis]] and [[Claudia Lennear]]. Minimal post-production was carried out on the recordings, ensuring that the album was a faithful document of the event. The box set's packaging included a 64-page book containing photos from the concerts; the album cover, designed by [[Tom Wilkes]], consisted of an image of a malnourished child sitting beside an empty food bowl. The album was delayed for three months due to protracted negotiations between Harrison and two record companies keen to protect their business interests, [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] and [[Columbia Records|Columbia/CBS]].\n\nOn release, ''The Concert for Bangladesh'' was a major critical and commercial success. It topped albums charts in several countries and went on to win the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in March 1973. Together with the 1972 [[The Concert for Bangladesh (film)|Apple concert film]] directed by [[Saul Swimmer]], the album gained [[Indian classical music]] its largest [[Western world|Western audience]] up until that time. It was reissued in 2005, four years after Harrison's death, with revised artwork. As of 2011, sales of the album continue to benefit the George Harrison Fund for [[UNICEF]], which raised $1.2 million for children in the [[Horn of Africa]], in a campaign marking the album's 40th anniversary.\n\n== Concerts ==\n{{Main|The Concert for Bangladesh}}\n{{quote box|quote= That whole show was a stroke of luck.

He was eventually supported by seven additional soldiers, led by Captain Thomas Preston, who were hit by clubs, stones, and snowballs. Eventually, one soldier fired, prompting the others to fire without an order by Preston.

Eight soldiers, one officer, and four civilians were arrested and charged with murder, and they were defended in court by attorney, and future U.S. president, [[John Adams]]. Six of the soldiers were acquitted; the other two were convicted of [[manslaughter]] and given reduced sentences.

Boston also was a center of resistance to unpopular acts of taxation by the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]] in the 1760s.<ref name=K54/>\n\nIn 1768, the [[Townshend Acts]] were enacted in the Thirteen Colonies, placing tariffs on a variety of common items that were manufactured in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] and imported in the colonies. Colonists objected that the Acts were a violation of the natural, charter, and constitutional [[Rights of Englishmen|rights of British subjects]] in the colonies.<ref name=K54/> The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Acts by sending a petition to [[George III of the United Kingdom#American War of Independence|King George III]] asking for the repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act.

He also ordered Massachusetts Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]] to direct the Massachusetts House to rescind the letter. The house refused to comply.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', p. 56.</ref>\n\nBoston's chief customs officer Charles Paxton wrote to Hillsborough for military support because \"the Government is as much in the hands of the people as it was in the time of the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]].\"<ref>Triber, ''A True Republican'', p. 66.</ref> Commodore [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]] responded by sending the 50-gun warship {{HMS|Romney|1762|6}}, which arrived in [[Boston Harbor]] in May 1768.<ref>Knollenberg, ''Growth'', p. 63.</ref> On June 10, 1768, customs officials seized ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'', a sloop owned by leading Boston merchant [[John Hancock]], on allegations that the ship had been involved in smuggling.

Church bells were rung, which usually signified a fire, bringing more people out. More than 50 Bostonians pressed around White, led by a mixed-race former slave named [[Crispus Attucks]], throwing objects at the sentry and challenging him to fire his weapon. White had taken up a somewhat safer position on the steps of the Custom House, and he sought assistance.

A thrown object then struck Private Montgomery, knocking him down and causing him to drop his musket.

Mr. Gillespie upon this resolved to go home, and in his way met numbers of people who were running past him, of whom many were armed with clubs and sticks, and some with other weapons. At the same time a number of people passed by him with two fire-engines, as if there had been a fire in the town. But they were soon told that there was no fire, but that the people were going to fight the soldiers, upon which they immediately quitted the fire-engines, and swore they would go to their assistance.

Both sides published pamphlets that told strikingly different stories, and which were principally published in [[London]] in a bid to influence opinion there. The ''Boston Gazette''{{'s}} version of events, for example, characterized the massacre as part of an ongoing scheme to \"quell a Spirit of Liberty\", and harped on the negative consequences of quartering troops in the city.<ref>York, \"Rival Truths\", p. 68.</ref>\n\n[[Henry Pelham (engraver)|Henry Pelham]] was an engraver and half-brother of celebrated portrait painter [[John Singleton Copley]], and he depicted the event in an engraving. Silversmith and engraver [[Paul Revere]] closely copied the image and is often credited as its originator. The engraving contained several inflammatory details. Captain Preston is shown ordering his men to fire, and a musket is seen shooting out of the window of the customs office, which is labeled \"Butcher's Hall\".<ref>Triber, ''A True Republican'', p. 80.</ref> Artist Christian Remick hand-colored some prints.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Fischer, ''Paul Revere's Ride'', 24.</ref> Some copies of the print show a man with two chest wounds and a somewhat darker face, matching descriptions of Attucks; others show no black victim. The image was published in the ''Boston Gazette'' and circulated widely, and it became an effective anti-British editorial. The image of soldiers in red uniforms and wounded men with red blood was hung in farmhouses throughout New England.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Jane|title=Paul Revere – Patriot Engraver|journal=Early American Life|pages=34–37|date=April 1975}}</ref>\n\nAnonymous pamphlets were published describing the event from significantly different perspectives. ''A Short Narrative of the Horrid Massacre'' was published under the auspices of the Boston town meeting, principally written by [[James Bowdoin]], a member of the governor's council and a vocal opponent of British colonial policy, along with Samuel Pemberton and Joseph Warren.<ref>Walett, pp. 330–333.</ref> It described the shooting and other lesser incidents that took place in the days before as unprovoked attacks on peaceful, law-abiding inhabitants and, according to historian Neal Langley York, was probably the most influential description of the event.<ref>York, \"Rival Truths\", p. 70.</ref> The account which it provided was drawn from more than 90 depositions taken after the event, and it included accusations that the soldiers sent by Captain Preston had been deployed with the intention of causing harm.<ref>York, \"Rival Truths\", p. 72.</ref> In the interest of minimizing impact on the jury pool, city leaders held back local distribution of the pamphlet, but they sent copies to other colonies and to London, where they knew that depositions were headed which Governor Hutchinson had collected.<ref>York, \"Rival Truths\", pp. 73–74.</ref> A second pamphlet entitled ''Additional Observations'' on the ''Short Narrative'' furthered the attack on crown officials by complaining that customs officials were abandoning their posts under the pretense that it was too dangerous for them to do their duties; one customs official had left Boston to carry Hutchinson's gathered depositions to London.<ref>York, \"Rival Truths\", p. 77.</ref>\n\nHutchinson's depositions were eventually published in a pamphlet entitled ''A Fair Account of the Late Unhappy Disturbance in Boston'',<ref name=\"York74\"/> drawn mainly from the depositions of soldiers. Its account of affairs sought to blame Bostonians for denying the validity of Parliamentary laws. It also blamed the city's citizens for the lawlessness preceding the event, and claimed that they set up an ambush of the soldiers.<ref>York, \"Rival Truths\", p. 75.</ref> As it was not published until well after the first pamphlet had arrived in London, it had a much smaller impact on the public debate there.<ref name=\"York74\">York, \"Rival Truths\", p. 74.</ref>\n\n===Trials===\n[[File:John Adams (1766).jpg|thumb|[[John Adams]] defended the soldiers, six of whom were acquitted.]]\n[[File:Boston_Massacre,_Boston_Gazette_newspaper_clipping,_1770-03-12.png|thumb|The March 12, 1770 newspaper report in the ''Boston Gazette'', four days after the funeral; the illustration of the coffins depicts the initials of the four victims buried that day.]]\n{{Quote| text=The Part I took in Defence of Cptn.

The United States led a [[Participants in Operation Enduring Freedom|multi-national coalition]] in an [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]] after the [[Taliban]] government was unable to extradite Al-Qaeda leader [[Osama bin Laden]] within 24 hours. Other international conflicts in 2001 were the [[2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff|standoff]] between India and Pakistan as well as the [[Second Intifada]] between Israel and Palestine. Internal conflicts began [[2001 insurgency in Macedonia|in Macedonia]], [[2001 Central African Republic coup d'état attempt|in the Central African Republic]], and [[RFDG Insurgency|in Guinea]]. Political challenges or violent conflicts caused changes in leadership in Argentina, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines.\n\n2001 was the second hottest year on record at the time, which was amplified by the end of a years-long [[La Niña]] phase. The Atlantic and Pacific tropical storm seasons were both more active than usual. The deadly [[Bhuj Earthquake]] took place in [[Gujarat]] on January 26, while the strongest earthquake in 36 years [[2001 southern Peru earthquake|took place in Peru]] on June 23. A potential health crisis occurred when [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|a major outbreak]] of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] spread among British livestock, bringing about the deaths of millions of animals. Four [[hominid]] species were described or proposed, and several major archaeological finds took place, including a set of [[terracotta]] citizens near the [[Terracotta Army]]. The [[pygmy three-toed sloth]] was also first [[Species description|described]] in 2001. The year had the fewest successful orbital spaceflights since 1963, with eight crewed missions. Successes in space exploration included the landing of ''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]'' on an asteroid and the arrival of ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey]]'' on Mars.\n\nPolitics and religion in the final months of 2001 focused intently on the [[Muslim world]] and [[Islamic terrorism]] after the September 11 attacks. The [[Catholic Church]] was active in 2001, as [[Pope John Paul II]] went on several goodwill trips to meet with non-Catholic religious groups and investigations of [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|sexual abuse cases]] among the church's priests began. Former [[President of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav president]] [[Slobodan Milošević]] was arrested and became the first head of state to be charged with [[crimes against humanity]] by an international body. The [[27th G8 summit]] took place in [[Genoa]] and was met by 200,000 protestors, where [[Death of Carlo Giuliani|one was killed]]. 2001 took place during a [[Early 2000s recession|minor recession]] among developed and developing nations, with only middle income nations avoiding an economic downturn. The recession saw economic crises take place [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|in Argentina]] and [[2001 Turkish economic crisis|in Turkey]]. American energy company [[Enron]] and the European airlines [[Sabena]] and [[Swissair]] all ended operations in 2001. In popular culture, the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'']] and [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'']] film franchises were launched, the [[iPod]] and [[iTunes]] were invented for music, and [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|three major sixth-generation video game systems]] became available. The [[Mac OS X]] and [[Windows XP]] were launched, as was the [[Wikipedia]] project. {{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe [[world population]] on January 1, 2001, was estimated to be 6.190&nbsp;billion people and increased to 6.272&nbsp;billion people by January 1, 2002.<ref name=\"UN Pop Prospects-2022\">{{Cite report |url=https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/ |title=World Population Prospects 2022 |date=2022 |publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs |access-date=November 28, 2022 |archive-date=July 11, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220711213112/https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/ |url-status=live }}</ref> An estimated 133.9&nbsp;million births and 52.1&nbsp;million deaths took place in 2001.<ref name=\"UN Pop Prospects-2022\" /> The average global [[life expectancy]] was 66.8 years, an increase of 0.3 years from 2000.<ref name=\"UN Pop Prospects-2022\" /> The rate of [[child mortality]] was 7.32%, a decrease of 0.26[[Percentage point|pp]] from 2000.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Roser |first1=Max |author1-link=Max Roser |last2=Ritchie |first2=Hannah |author2-link=Hannah Ritchie |last3=Dadonaite |first3=Bernadeta |title=Child and Infant Mortality |url=https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality |journal=Our World in Data |date=May 10, 2013 |access-date=November 28, 2022 |archive-date=December 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211216051011/https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality |url-status=live }}</ref> 28.25% of people were living in [[extreme poverty]], a decrease of 0.88pp from 2000.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Hasell |first1=Joe |last2=Roser |first2=Max |last3=Ortiz-Ospina |first3=Esteban |last4=Arrigada |first4=Pablo |title=Poverty |url=https://ourworldindata.org/poverty |journal=Our World in Data |date=October 17, 2022 |access-date=November 28, 2022 |archive-date=November 28, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221128215030/https://ourworldindata.org/poverty |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThere were approximately 12&nbsp;million global refugees in 2001. 500,000 were settled over the course of the year, but about the same number of people were displaced in other locations, causing the number of refugees to remain largely unchanged.

It is a fundamental property of many binary operations, and many [[mathematical proof]]s depend on it. Perhaps most familiar as a property of arithmetic, e.g. {{nowrap|1=\"3 + 4 = 4 + 3\"}} or {{nowrap|1=\"2 × 5 = 5 × 2\"}}, the property can also be used in more advanced settings. The name is needed because there are operations, such as [[division (mathematics)|division]] and [[subtraction]], that do not have it (for example, {{nowrap|\"3 − 5 ≠ 5 − 3\"}}); such operations are ''not'' commutative, and so are referred to as ''noncommutative operations''. The idea that simple operations, such as the [[multiplication (mathematics)|multiplication]] and [[addition]] of numbers, are commutative was for many years implicitly assumed. Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, when mathematics started to become formalized.<ref name=\"Cabillón\" /><ref name=Flood11 /> A similar property exists for [[binary relation]]s; a binary relation is said to be [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] if the relation applies regardless of the order of its operands; for example, [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] is symmetric as two equal mathematical objects are equal regardless of their order.<ref>{{MathWorld|id=SymmetricRelation|title=Symmetric Relation}}</ref>\n\n== Mathematical definitions ==\nA [[binary operation]] <math>*</math> on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is called ''commutative'' if<ref name=\"Krowne, p.1\">Krowne, p. 1</ref><ref>Weisstein, ''Commute'', p. 1</ref>\n<math display=\"block\">x * y = y * x\\qquad\\mbox{for all }x,y\\in S.</math> \nIn other words, an operation is commutative if every two elements commute.  An operation that does not satisfy the above property is called ''noncommutative''.\n\nOne says that {{mvar|x}} ''commutes'' with {{math|''y''}} or that {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} ''commute'' under <math>*</math> if\n<math display=\"block\"> x * y = y * x.</math>\nThat is, a specific pair of elements may commute even if the operation is (strictly) noncommutative.\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Commutative Addition.svg|thumb|The cumulation of apples, which can be seen as an addition of natural numbers, is commutative.]]\n\n=== Commutative operations ===\n[[File:Vector Addition.svg|thumb|The addition of vectors is commutative, because <math>\\vec a+\\vec b=\\vec b+ \\vec a.</math>]]\n* [[Addition]] and [[multiplication]] are commutative in most [[number system]]s, and, in particular, between [[natural number]]s, [[integer]]s, [[rational number]]s, [[real number]]s and [[complex number]]s. This is also true in every [[field (mathematics)|field]].\n* Addition is commutative in every [[vector space]] and in every [[algebra over a field|algebra]].\n* [[Union (set theory)|Union]] and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] are commutative operations on [[set (mathematics)|set]]s.\n* \"[[And (logic)|And]]\" and \"[[or (logic)|or]]\" are commutative [[logical operation]]s.\n\n=== Noncommutative operations ===\n==== Division, subtraction, and exponentiation ====\n{{See also|1=Equation xy = yx}}\n[[Division (mathematics)|Division]] is noncommutative, since <math>1 \\div 2 \\neq 2 \\div 1</math>.\n\n[[Subtraction]] is noncommutative, since <math>0 - 1 \\neq 1 - 0</math>.

Today the commutative property is a well-known and basic property used in most branches of mathematics.\n\nThe first recorded use of the term ''commutative'' was in a memoir by [[François-Joseph Servois|François Servois]] in 1814,<ref name=\"Cabillón\">{{harvnb|Cabillón|Miller|loc=''Commutative and Distributive''}}</ref><ref>O'Conner & Robertson, ''Servois''</ref> which used the word ''commutatives'' when describing functions that have what is now called the commutative property. ''Commutative'' is the feminine form of the French adjective ''commutatif'', which is derived from the French noun ''commutation'' and the French verb ''commuter'', meaning \"to exchange\" or \"to switch\", a cognate of ''to commute''. The term then appeared in English in 1838.<ref name=Flood11>{{cite book|title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain|editor1-first=Raymond|editor1-last=Flood|editor2-first=Adrian|editor2-last=Rice|editor3-first=Robin|editor3-last=Wilson|editor3-link=Robin Wilson (mathematician)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YruifIx88AQC&pg=PA4|page=4|isbn=9780191627941}}</ref> in [[Duncan Gregory]]'s article entitled \"On the real nature of symbolical algebra\" published in 1840 in the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]].<ref>{{Cite journal|first=D.

The following [[logical equivalence]]s demonstrate that commutativity is a property of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].\n\n;Commutativity of conjunction: <math>(P \\land Q) \\leftrightarrow (Q \\land P)</math>\n;Commutativity of disjunction: <math>(P \\lor Q) \\leftrightarrow (Q \\lor P)</math>\n;Commutativity of implication (also called the law of permutation): <math>\\big(P \\to (Q \\to R)\\big) \\leftrightarrow \\big(Q \\to (P \\to R)\\big)</math>\n;Commutativity of equivalence (also called the complete commutative law of equivalence): <math>(P \\leftrightarrow Q) \\leftrightarrow (Q \\leftrightarrow P)</math>\n\n== Set theory ==\nIn [[group theory|group]] and [[set theory]], many algebraic structures are called commutative when certain operands satisfy the commutative property.  In higher branches of mathematics, such as [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[linear algebra]] the commutativity of well-known operations (such as [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] on real and complex numbers) is often used (or implicitly assumed) in proofs.<ref>{{harvnb|Axler|1997|p=2}}</ref><ref name=\"Gallian, p. 34\">{{harvnb|Gallian|2006|p=34}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gallian|2006|pp=26,87}}</ref>\n\n== Mathematical structures and commutativity ==\n* A [[commutative semigroup]] is a set endowed with a total, [[associativity|associative]] and commutative operation.\n* If the operation additionally has an [[identity element]], we have a [[commutative monoid]]\n* An [[abelian group]], or ''commutative group'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] whose group operation is commutative.<ref name=\"Gallian, p. 34\"/>\n* A [[commutative ring]] is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] whose [[multiplication]] is commutative. (Addition in a ring is always commutative.)<ref>{{harvnb|Gallian|2006|p=236}}</ref>\n* In a [[field (mathematics)|field]] both addition and multiplication are commutative.<ref>{{harvnb|Gallian|2006|p=250}}</ref>\n\n== Related properties ==\n\n=== Associativity ===\n{{Main|Associative property}}\n\nThe associative property is closely related to the commutative property.  The associative property of an expression containing two or more occurrences of the same operator states that the order operations are performed in does not affect the final result, as long as the order of terms does not change. In contrast, the commutative property states that the order of the terms does not affect the final result.\n\nMost commutative operations encountered in practice are also associative. However, commutativity does not imply associativity. A counterexample is the function\n<math display=\"block\">f(x, y) = \\frac{x + y}{2},</math>\nwhich is clearly commutative (interchanging ''x'' and ''y'' does not affect the result), but it is not associative (since, for example, <math>f(-4, f(0, +4)) = -1</math> but <math>f(f(-4, 0), +4) = +1</math>). More such examples may be found in [[commutative non-associative magmas]]. Furthermore, associativity does not imply commutativity either – for example multiplication of [[Quaternion#Algebraic properties|quaternions]] or of [[Matrix multiplication|matrices]] is always associative but not always commutative.\n\n=== Distributivity ===\n{{Main|Distributive property}}\n\n=== Symmetry ===\n[[File:Symmetry of addition.svg|right|thumb|200px|Graph showing the symmetry of the addition function <math>z=x+y</math>]]\nSome forms of [[Symmetry in mathematics|symmetry]] can be directly linked to commutativity.  When a commutative operation is written as a [[binary function]] <math>z=f(x,y),</math> then this function is called a [[symmetric function]], and its [[graph of a function|graph]] in [[three-dimensional space]] is symmetric across the plane <math>y=x</math>. For example, if the function {{math|''f''}} is defined as <math>f(x,y)=x+y</math> then <math>f</math> is a symmetric function.\n\nFor relations, a [[symmetric relation]] is analogous to a commutative operation, in that if a relation ''R'' is symmetric, then <math>a R b \\Leftrightarrow b R a</math>.\n\n== Non-commuting operators in quantum mechanics ==\n{{Main|Canonical commutation relation}}\n\nIn [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]] as formulated by [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], physical variables are represented by [[linear operators]] such as <math>x</math> (meaning multiply by <math>x</math>), and <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{d}{dx}</math>. These two operators do not commute as may be seen by considering the effect of their [[Function composition|compositions]] <math display=\"inline\">x \\frac{d}{dx}</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{d}{dx} x</math> (also called products of operators) on a one-dimensional [[wave function]] <math>\\psi(x)</math>:\n<math display=\"block\"> x\\cdot {\\mathrm{d}\\over \\mathrm{d}x}\\psi = x\\cdot \\psi' \\ \\neq \\ \\psi + x\\cdot \\psi' = {\\mathrm{d}\\over \\mathrm{d}x}\\left( x\\cdot \\psi \\right) </math>\n\nAccording to the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], if the two operators representing a pair of variables do not commute, then that pair of variables are mutually [[complementarity (physics)|complementary]], which means they cannot be simultaneously measured or known precisely. For example, the position and the linear [[momentum]] in the <math>x</math>-direction of a particle are represented by the operators <math>x</math> and <math>-i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}</math>, respectively (where <math>\\hbar</math> is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]]). This is the same example except for the constant <math>-i \\hbar</math>, so again the operators do not commute and the physical meaning is that the position and linear momentum in a given direction are complementary.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [[Anticommutative property]]\n* [[Centralizer|Centralizer and normalizer]] (also called a commutant)\n* [[Commutative diagram]]\n* [[Commutative (neurophysiology)]]\n* [[Commutator]]\n* [[Parallelogram law]]\n* [[Particle statistics]] (for commutativity in [[physics]])\n* [[Proofs involving the addition of natural numbers#Proof of commutativity|Proof that Peano's axioms imply the commutativity of the addition of natural numbers]]\n* [[Quasi-commutative property]]\n* [[Trace monoid]]\n* [[Commuting probability]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Books ===\n* {{Cite book| first=Sheldon | last=Axler | title=Linear Algebra Done Right, 2e | publisher=Springer | year=1997 | isbn=0-387-98258-2}}\n*: ''Abstract algebra theory.

The ACF chose a {{convert|103.18|km|adj=on}} circuit, composed primarily of dust roads sealed with [[tar]], which would be lapped six times on both days by each competitor, a combined race distance of {{convert|1238.16|km}}. Lasting for more than 12&nbsp;hours overall, the race was won by [[Ferenc Szisz]] driving for the [[Renault]] team. [[Fiat|FIAT]] driver [[Felice Nazzaro]] finished second, and [[Albert Clément]] was third in a [[Clément-Bayard]].\n\n[[Paul Baras]] of [[Brasier]] set the [[fastest lap]] of the race on his first lap. He held on to the lead until the third lap, when Szisz took over first position, defending it to the finish. Hot conditions melted the road tar, which the cars kicked up into the faces of the drivers, blinding them and making the racing treacherous. Punctures were common; tyre manufacturer [[Michelin]] introduced a detachable [[Rim (wheel)|rim]] with a tyre already affixed, which could be quickly swapped onto a car after a puncture, saving a significant amount of time over manually replacing the tyre. This helped Nazzaro pass Clément on the second day, as the FIAT—unlike the Clément-Bayard—made use of the rims.\n\nRenault's victory contributed to an increase in sales for the French manufacturer in the years following the race. Despite being the second to carry the title, the race has become known as the first Grand Prix. The success of the 1906 French Grand Prix prompted the ACF to run the Grand Prix again the [[1907 French Grand Prix|following year]], and the German automobile industry to organise the [[Kaiserpreis]], the forerunner to the [[German Grand Prix]], in 1907.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Gordon Bennett 1904-notext.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An open-topped sports car, with the number 5 written on the front and side.

Intended to encourage [[Automotive industry|automobile industries]] through sport, by 1903 the Gordon Bennett races had become some of the most prestigious in Europe;<ref name=\"Hodges p. 1\">Hodges (1967), p. 1</ref> their formula of closed-road racing among similar cars replaced the previous model of unregulated vehicles racing between distant towns, over open roads. Entries into the Gordon Bennett races were by country, and the winning country earned the right to organise the next race.<ref name=\"Cimarosti p. 19\">Cimarosti (1986), p. 19</ref> Entries were limited to three per country, which meant that although the nascent motor industry in Europe was dominated by French manufacturers, they were denied the opportunity to fully demonstrate their superiority. Instead, the rule put them on a numerical level footing with countries such as Switzerland, with only one manufacturer, and allowed [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes]], which had factories in Germany and Austria, to field six entries: three from each country.<ref name=\"Hilton p. 15\">Hilton (2005), p. 15</ref> The French [[sports governing body|governing body]], the [[Automobile Club of France|Automobile Club de France]] (ACF), held trials between its manufacturers before each race; in 1904 twenty-nine entries competed for the three positions on offer.<ref name=\"when?\">{{cite web\n|url= http://forix.autosport.com/8w/f06.html\n|title= The first Grand Prix\n|author= Leif Snellman\n|work= 8W\n|publisher= FORIX\n|date= 2002-05-27\n|access-date= 2011-01-28}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Léon Théry]] won the 1904 race for the French manufacturer [[Brasier|Richard-Brasier]], the French automobile industry proposed to the ACF that they modify the format of the 1905 Gordon Bennett race and run it simultaneously with an event which did not limit entries by nation.<ref name=\"Hodges p. 1\"/> The ACF accepted the proposal, but decided that instead of removing limits to entries by nation, the limits would remain but would be determined by the size of each country's industry. Under the ACF's proposal, France was allowed fifteen entries, Germany and Britain six, and the remaining countries—Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria and the United States—three cars each.<ref name=\"Hodges p. 2\">Hodges (1967), p. 2</ref>\n\nThe French proposal was met with strong opposition from governing bodies representing the other Gordon Bennett nations, and at the instigation of Germany a meeting of the bodies was organised to settle the dispute. Although the delegates rejected the French model for the 1905 race, to avoid deadlock they agreed to use the new system of limits for the 1906 race. But when Théry and Richard-Brasier won again in 1905, and the responsibility for organising the 1906 race fell once more to the ACF, the French ended the Gordon Bennett races and organised their own event as a replacement, the Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France.<ref name=\"Hodges p. 2\"/>\n\n=== Track ===\n[[File:1906 French Grand Prix Szisz.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=An open-topped sports car, with '3A' written on the front, kicks up dust as it drives along a road lined with trees and grass.

The town was bypassed with a temporary wooden [[plank road]], as the track headed north on the next leg of the triangle. Another plank road through a forest to a minor road allowed the track to bypass most of the town of [[Vibraye]], before it again headed north to the outskirts of [[La Ferté-Bernard]]. A series of left-hand turns took competitors back south-west towards Montfort on the last leg of the triangle, a straight broken by a more technical winding section, near the town of [[Connerré]].<ref name=\"Hilton p. 16\">Hilton (2005), p. 16</ref><ref name=\"Hodges p. 222\">Hodges (1967), p. 222</ref> Competitors lapped the circuit twelve times over two days, six times on each day, a total distance of {{convert|1238.16|km}}.<ref name=\"Hodges p. 221\"/>\n\nTo address concerns about previous races, during which spectators crowding too close to the track had been killed or injured by cars, the ACF erected {{convert|65|km}} of [[palisade]] fencing around the circuit, concentrated around towns and villages, and at the ends of lanes, footpaths and roads intersecting the track.<ref name=\"Hilton p. 16\" /> The planking used to avoid the towns of Saint-Calais and Vibraye was installed as an alternative to the system used in the Gordon Bennett races, where cars passing through towns would slow down to a set speed and were forbidden to overtake.<ref name=\"Pomeroy p. 21\">Pomeroy (1949), p. 21.</ref> Several [[footbridge]]s were erected over the track, and a 2,000-seat canopied [[grandstand]] was built at the start and finish line at Montfort.

Following the same principle, Clément began at 6:11&nbsp;am and Nazzaro at 6:26&nbsp;am. This method ensured that positions on the road directly reflected the race standings.

It can be recognized by its distinctive pale green [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that measures up to {{convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, the surface of which is covered with darker green angular patches. It has crowded white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], and a firm, white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] that is up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. Considered to be one of the best [[edible mushroom]]s of the genus ''Russula'', it is especially popular in Spain and China. With a taste that is described variously as mild, nutty, fruity, or sweet, it is cooked by [[grilling]], [[frying]], [[sautéeing]], or eaten raw. Mushrooms are rich in [[carbohydrate]]s and [[dietary protein|proteins]], with a low [[fat]] content.\n\nThe species was described as new to science in 1774 by [[Jacob Christian Schaeffer]]. Its distribution encompasses Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America. Its presence in North America has not been clarified, due to confusion with the similar species ''[[Russula parvovirescens]]'' and ''[[Russula crustosa|R.&nbsp;crustosa]]''. ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' fruits singly or scattered on the ground in both [[deciduous]] and [[mixed forest]]s, forming [[mycorrhiza]]l associations with broadleaf trees such as [[oak]], [[Fagus sylvatica|European beech]], and [[aspen]]. In Asia, it associates with several species of tropical lowland [[rainforest]] trees of the family [[Dipterocarpaceae]]. ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' has a [[ribonuclease]] enzyme with a [[biochemistry]] unique among edible mushrooms. It also has [[biological activity|biologically active]] [[polysaccharide]]s, and a [[laccase]] enzyme that can break down several [[dye]]s used in the laboratory and in the [[textile industry]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Russula virescens illustration 1898.jpg|thumb|left|1898 illustration by [[Louis Charles Christopher Krieger]]]]\n''Russula virescens'' was first described by German [[polymath]] [[Jacob Christian Schaeffer]] in 1774 as ''Agaricus virescens''.<ref name=\"Schaeffer 1774\"/> The species was subsequently transferred to the genus ''Russula'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries|Elias Fries]] in 1836.<ref name=\"Fries 1836\"/><ref name=\"urlFungorum: Russula virescens\"/> According to the [[Scientific nomenclature|nomenclatural]] authority [[MycoBank]], ''Russula furcata'' var. ''aeruginosa'' (published by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1796<ref name=\"Persoon 1796\"/>) and ''Agaricus caseosus'' (published by [[Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth]] in 1883<ref name=\"Wallroth 1833\"/>) are [[synonym (biology)|synonyms]] of ''Russula virescens''.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Russula virescens\"/> The [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''albidocitrina'', defined by [[Claude Casimir Gillet]] in 1876,<ref name=\"Gillet 1876\"/> is no longer considered to have independent [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] significance.<ref name=\"urlMycoBank: Russula virescens var. albidocitrina\"/> According to [[Rolf Singer]]'s 1986 [[classification (biology)|classification]] of ''Russula'', ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' is the [[type species]] of [[Subsection (botany)|subsection]] ''Virescentinae'' in section ''Rigidae'', a grouping of mushrooms characterized by a cap surface that breaks into patches of bran-like (furfuraceous) particles.<ref name=\"Singer 1986\"/> In a [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis of European ''Russula'', ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' formed a [[clade]] with ''[[Russula mustelina|R.&nbsp;mustelina]]''; these two species were [[sister group|sister]] to a clade containing ''[[Russula amoenicolor|R.&nbsp;amoenicolor]]'' and ''[[Russula violeipes|R.&nbsp;violeipes]]''.<ref name=\"Miller 2002\"/>\n\nThe [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''virescens'' is [[Latin]] for \"becoming green\".<ref name=\"Findlay 1967\"/> The characteristic pattern of the cap surface has earned the species [[common name]]s such as the green-cracking russula, the quilted green russula,<ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/> and the green brittlegill.<ref name=\"McKnight 1987\"/> In the [[mid-Atlantic United States]], it is also known locally as the moldy russula.<ref name=\"Russell 2006\"/>\n\n== Description ==\n\nDescribed by mushroom enthusiast [[Antonio Carluccio]] as \"not exactly nice to look at\", the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is at first dome or barrel-shaped, becoming convex and flattened with age with a diameter of up to {{convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. The cap center is often depressed.<ref name=\"Carluccio 2003\"/> The [[pileipellis|cuticle]] of the cap is green, most profoundly in the center, with patches of the same color dispersed radially around the center in an [[wikt:areolate|areolate]] pattern.<ref name=\"McKnight 1987\"/> The color of the cuticle is often of variable shade, ranging from gray to [[verdigris]] to grass-green. The extent of the patching of the cuticle is also variable, giving specimens with limited patches a resemblance to other green-capped species of ''Russula'', such as ''[[Russula aeruginea|R.&nbsp;aeruginea]]''. The green patches of the cap lie on a white to pale green background. The cap, while frequently round, may also exhibit irregular lobes and cracks. The cap cuticle is thin, and can be readily peeled off the surface to a distance of about halfway towards the cap center.<ref name=\"McKnight 1987\"/>\nThe [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white to cream colored, and fairly crowded together; they are mostly free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. Gills are interconnected at their bases by veins.<ref name=\"urlRogers Mushrooms\"/> The stipe is cylindrical, white, and of variable height, up to {{convert|8|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide;<ref name=\"Petersen 1990\"/> it is roughly the same thickness at both the top and the base. The top portion of the stipe may be farinose—covered with a white, mealy powder.<ref name=\"Jordan 2004\"/> It may turn slightly brown with age, or when it is injured or bruised from handling.<ref name=\"Healy 2008\"/> Like other mushrooms in the [[Russulales]], the [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is brittle, owing to the sphaerocyst cytoarchitecture—cylindrical cells that contrast with the typical fibrous, filamentous [[hypha]]e present in other orders of the [[basidiomycota]].<ref name=\"urlRussulales News / Characteristics of the russuloid fungi\"/>\n[[File:Russula virescens 105520.jpg|thumb|left|Spores are translucent and warted.]]\nThe [[basidiospore|spores]] of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' are elliptical or [[ellipsoid]] with warts, translucent ([[hyaline]]), and produce a white, pale or pale yellow [[spore print]];<ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/><ref name=\"Hinkova 1986\"/> the spore dimensions are 6–9 by 5–7&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/> A partial reticulum (net-like pattern of ridges) interconnects the warts.

The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are 40–85 by 6–8&nbsp;μm and end abruptly in a sharp point.<ref name=\"Bi 1993\"/>\n\n=== Similar species ===\n''Russula parvovirescens'', found in the eastern United States, can be distinguished from ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' by its smaller stature, with caps measuring {{convert|4|–|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide and stipe up to {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. Compared to ''R.&nbsp;virescens'', it tends to be more bluish-green, the patches on its cap are larger, and it has a lined cap margin. Microscopically, the terminal cells in the cap cuticle of ''R.&nbsp;parvovirescens'' are more swollen than those of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'', which has tapered and elongated terminal cells.<ref name=\"Buyck 2006\"/> Another green-capped ''Russula'' is ''[[Russula aeruginea|R.&nbsp;aeruginea]]'', but this species may be distinguished from ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' by its smaller size and smooth cap.<ref name=\"Metzler 1992\"/> Other green russulas with a smooth cap include ''[[Russula heterophylla|R.&nbsp;heterophylla]]'' and [[Russula cyanoxantha|''R.&nbsp;cyanoxantha'' var.

Mushrooms can be [[Sautéing|sautéed]] (the green color disappears with cooking), and young specimens that are prepared this way have a potato taste that pairs well with [[shallot]]s.<ref name=\"Kuo 2007\"/> They are also fried or grilled,<ref name=\"Zeitlmayr 1976\"/> or used raw in salads.<ref name=\"Schunko 2010\"/>  Young specimens are pale and can be hard to identify, but the characteristic pattern of older fruit bodies makes them hard to confuse with other species. When collecting ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' for consumption, caution is of vital importance to avoid confusion with the dangerously poisonous ''[[Amanita phalloides]]'' (better known as the [[death cap]]), a mushroom that can be most easily identified by its [[volva (mycology)|volva]] and [[annulus (mycology)|ring]].<ref name=\"Zeitlmayr 1976\"/><!-- cites previous three sentences -->\n{{quotation|text=A lady amateur mycophagist of the writer's acquaintance,&nbsp;... who is especially fond of the green Russula, is never at a loss for this especially prized tidbit as a reward for her daily stroll among the trees.

Fresh mushrooms contain about 92.5% moisture. A {{convert|100|g|oz|adj=on}} sample of dried mushroom (100&nbsp;g&nbsp;dw) has 365 [[calorie|kcal]] (1527 [[kilojoules]]). [[Carbohydrate]]s make up the bulk of the fruit bodies, comprising 62% of the dry weight; 11.1% of the carbohydrates are [[sugar]]s, the large majority of which (10.9%) is [[mannitol]]. The total [[lipid]], or crude fat, content makes up 1.85% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of [[fatty acid]]s (expressed as a percentage of total fatty acids) are 28.78% [[saturated fat|saturated]], 41.51% [[monounsaturated fat|monounsaturated]], and 29.71% [[polyunsaturated fatty acid|polyunsaturated]]. The most prevalent fatty acids include: [[palmitic acid]], 17.3% of total fatty acids; [[stearic acid]], 7.16%; [[oleic acid]], 40.27%; and [[linoleic acid]], 29.18%. Several [[biological activity|bioactive]] compounds are present in the mushroom. One hundred grams (dry weight) contains 49.3 [[microgram]]s (μg) of [[tocopherol]]s (20.0&nbsp;μg [[alpha-Tocopherol|alpha]], 21.3&nbsp;μg [[beta-Tocopherol|beta]], and 8.0&nbsp;μg [[gamma-Tocopherol|gamma]]) and 0.19 milligrams (mg) of the [[carotenoid]] pigment [[lycopene]]. There are 4.46&nbsp;g of [[organic acid]]s per 100&nbsp;g of dry mushrooms, including [[oxalic acid]] (0.78&nbsp;g), [[malic acid]] (2.71&nbsp;g), [[citric acid]] (0.55&nbsp;g), and [[fumaric acid]] (0.23&nbsp;g). Mushrooms have 22.6&nbsp;mg/100&nbsp;g&nbsp;dw of the [[phenols|phenolic]] compound [[4-hydroxybenzoic acid]], and 15.8&nbsp;mg/100&nbsp;g&nbsp;dw of [[cinnamic acid]].<ref name=\"Leal 2013\"/>\n\n== Habitat and distribution ==\n[[File:Russula virescens 89201.jpg|thumb|right|Young mushrooms with light green coloration]]\n''Russula virescens'' can be found fruiting on soil in both [[Temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forests]] and [[mixed forest]]s,<ref name=\"McKnight 1987\"/> forming [[ectomycorrhiza]]l [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with a variety of trees, including oaks (''[[Quercus]]''), European beech (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]''), and aspen (''[[Populus tremula]]'').<ref name=\"Trappe 1962\"/> Preliminary investigations suggest that the fungus also associates with at least ten species of [[Dipterocarpaceae]], an important tree family prevalent in the tropical lowland forests of [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name=\"Brearly 2012\"/> Fruit bodies may appear singly or in groups,<ref name=\"Roody 2003\"/> reappear in the same spots year after year, and are not common. In Europe, fruiting occurs mainly during the months of summer to early autumn.<ref name=\"Jordan 2004\"/> A Mexican study of the seasonal occurrence of several common mushroom species in [[subtropical]] forests in [[Xalapa]] showed that the fruiting period of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' occurred in April, before the onset of the [[Wet season|rainy season]].<ref name=\"Chacon 1995\"/>\n\nThe distribution of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' in North America is subject to debate, where a number of similar species such as ''[[Russula parvovirescens|R.&nbsp;parvovirescens]]'' and ''[[Russula crustosa|R.&nbsp;crustosa]]'' are also recognized.<ref name=\"Buyck 2006\"/><ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> One author even suggests that ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' \"is strictly a European species\",<ref name=\"urlKuo\"/> citing Buyck and collaborators (2006), who say \"the ''virescens''-''crustosa'' group is much more complex than suspected and embraces at least a dozen taxa in the eastern US\".<ref name=\"Buyck 2006\"/> As in Europe, ''Russula virescens'' has a widespread distribution in Asia, having been recorded from India,<ref name=\"Das 2002\"/> Malaysia,<ref name=\"Watling 1998\"/> Korea,<ref name=\"Lee 1986\"/> the Philippines,<ref name=\"Sims 1997\"/> Nepal,<ref name=\"Christensen 2008\"/> China,<ref name=\"Peng 2003\"/> Thailand,<ref name=\"Høiland 2008\"/> and Vietnam.<ref name=\"Kiet 1998\"/> It is also found in North Africa and Central America.<ref name=\"Roberts 2011\"/>\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Russula virescens'' has a limited capacity to [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] the [[micronutrient]]s [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[zinc]] from the soil.  The concentration of these trace metals is slightly higher in the caps than the stipes. A {{convert|300|g|adj=on}} meal of fresh mushroom caps would supply 16% of the [[recommended daily allowance]] (RDA) of copper for an adult male or female (ages 19–50); 16% or 7.3% of the RDA of iron for an adult male or female, respectively; and 16–22% of the adult RDA of zinc.<ref name=\"Busuioc 2011\"/> The mushroom is a poor bioaccumulator of the toxic [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] [[arsenic]], [[cadmium]], [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[nickel]].<ref name=\"Chen 2009\"/>\n\n[[Biological activity|Biologically active]] mushroom [[polysaccharide]]s have been a frequent research topic in recent decades due to their possible stimulatory effect on [[innate immune system|innate]] and [[cell-mediated immunity|cell-mediated]] immune responses, antitumor activities, and other activities.<ref name=\"Wasser 2011\"/> Immunostimulatory activity, [[antioxidant]] activity, [[cholesterol]]-lowering, and [[blood sugar]]-lowering effects have been detected in extracts of ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' fruit bodies, which are attributed to polysaccharides.<ref name=\"Badalyan 2012\"/> A water-insoluble [[beta-glucan]], RVS3-II, has been isolated from the fruit bodies. [[Sulfation|Sulfated]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of this compound have antitumor activities against [[sarcoma]] tumor [[cell line]]s.<ref name=\"Sun 2009\"/> RVP, a water-soluble polysaccharide present in the mushroom, is made largely of [[galactomannan]] subunits and has antioxidant activity.<ref name=\"Sun 2010\"/>\n\n[[Ribonuclease]]s (or RNases) are [[enzyme]]s that [[enzyme catalysis|catalyze]] the [[hydrolysis]] of [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA), and collectively they play a critical role in many biological processes. A RNase from ''R.&nbsp;virescens'' was shown to be biochemically unique amongst seven edible mushroom species in several ways: it has a co-[[Specificity (biochemistry)#Specificity|specificity]] towards cleaving RNA at poly [[adenine|A]] and poly [[cytosine|C]], compared to the monospecific RNases of the others; it can be [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on [[column chromatography|chromatography]] columns containing [[Diethylaminoethyl cellulose|DEAE–cellulose]] as the adsorbent; it has a [[pH]] optimum of 4.5, lower than all other species; and, it has a \"distinctly different\" [[N-terminal]] [[amino acid sequence]].<ref name=\"Wang 2003\"/> The mushroom contains a unique [[laccase]] enzyme that can break down several [[dye]]s used in the laboratory and in the [[textile industry]], such as  [[bromothymol blue]], [[eriochrome black T]], [[malachite green]], and reactive brilliant blue.

      "reference_summary": "**\"Russula virescens,\"** commonly known as the green-cracking russula or quilted green russula, is an edible mushroom species characterized by its pale green cap with darker green patches, white gills, and a white stipe. It is considered one of the best edible mushrooms in its genus, often described as having a mild, nutty, fruity, or sweet flavor. Native to Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America, this species is found in deciduous and mixed forests, forming mycorrhizal relationships with broadleaf trees like oak and European beech. It is noted for its unique ribonuclease enzyme, biologically active polysaccharides, and laccase enzyme, which can break down dyes. Initially described by Jacob Christian Schaeffer in 1774, the species was later classified under the genus \"Russula\" by Elias Magnus Fries in 1836. Despite its popularity, its presence in North America remains unclear due to confusion with similar species. The mushroom is rich in carbohydrates and proteins, with a low fat content.",
      "base_model_summary": "Russula virescens, commonly known as the green-cracking russula or quilted green russula, is a basidiomycete mushroom recognized by its pale green cap with darker green patches, white gills, and a firm white stipe. It is considered one of the best edible mushrooms of the genus Russula, popular in Spain and China. The mushroom forms mycorrhizal associations with broadleaf and tropical rainforest trees and contains unique ribonuclease enzymes and biologically active polysaccharides. It was first described by Jacob Christian Schaeffer in 1774 and later classified by Elias Fries in 1836. Its distribution includes Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America, but its presence in North America remains unclear due to confusion with similar species. Russula virescens is rich in carbohydrates and proteins with a low fat content. It is cooked by grilling, frying, sautéing, or eaten raw. The species has a unique laccase enzyme capable of breaking down several dyes used in the textile industry. The mushroom is classified as choice edible. The taxonomic history includes several synonyms. Note: The summary captures the key points about the species' characteristics, edibility, distribution, associations, unique biochemical properties, and taxonomic history without unnecessary details. It also includes its common names and the fact that it is popular in certain regions. The summary is comprehensive but concise. The last sentence about the taxonomic history is omitted as it is less critical to the main focus of the article, which is the description and edibility of the mushroom. If more detail on taxonomy is needed, it can be added separately. If you need any specific aspect emphasized or clarified, please let me know! (Note: I've added a note regarding the last sentence about taxonomic history for clarity, as it was not included in the initial summary due to its relative importance.) \n\nIf you want the taxonomic history to be included, here's the revised version:\n\nSummary: Russula virescens, commonly known as the green-cracking russula or quilted green russula, is a basidiomycete mushroom recognized by its pale green cap with darker green patches, white gills, and a firm white stipe.

      "finetuned_model_summary": "Russula virescens, commonly known as the green-cracking russula or quilted green russula, is a basidiomycete mushroom recognized by its pale green cap with darker green angular patches and crowded white gills. It has a firm white stipe and is considered one of the best edible mushrooms in the genus Russula, popular in Spain and China. The mushroom forms mycorrhizal associations with broadleaf trees and has unique biochemical properties, including a ribonuclease enzyme and polysaccharides with biological activity. Described by Jacob Christian Schaeffer in 1774, it is distributed across Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America. However, its presence in North America is uncertain due to confusion with similar species. It can be cooked by grilling, frying, sautéing, or eaten raw and is rich in carbohydrates, proteins, and low in fat. The mushroom produces laccase enzymes capable of breaking down certain dyes used in laboratories and the textile industry. Russula virescens is classified under the genus Russula and has several synonyms. It thrives in both deciduous and mixed forests, as well as tropical lowland rainforests. Its distinctive appearance, taste, and biochemical properties make it a notable species within the Russula genus. Summary in English: Russula virescens, known as green-cracking or quilted green russula, is a basidiomycete mushroom with a pale green cap and white gills. It's one of the best edible mushrooms in its genus, popular in Spain and China. Found in Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Central America, it forms mycorrhizal associations with various trees and has unique biochemical properties, including a ribonuclease enzyme and polysaccharides. Described in 1774, its presence in North America is uncertain due to similarity with other species. It can be cooked or eaten raw, rich in carbohydrates and proteins, and produces laccase enzymes that break down certain dyes. It's notable for its distinctive appearance, taste, and biochemical properties within the Russula genus. Summary: Russula virescens, known by various names, is a basidiomycete mushroom with a pale green cap and white gills. It's one of the best edible mushrooms in its genus and popular in Spain and China. Found globally except North America, it forms mycorrhizal associations with trees and has unique biochemical properties like a ribonuclease enzyme and polysaccharides. Described in 1774, its",
